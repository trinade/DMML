0,"japan warns u.s. it may retaliate in trade dispute japan warned the united states it may take retaliatory measures if the united states imposes its planned trade sanctions on april 17, a senior government official said.     shinji fukukawa, vice minister of the international trade and industry ministry, said in a statement japan would consider measures under the general agreement on tariffs and trade and other actions if the united states imposes 100 pct tariffs on some japanese exports as planned next week.     however, fukukawa said japan was ready to continue trade talks with the united states despite its failure to convince america to call off the threatened tariffs during two days of emergency talks which ended in washington yesterday.     last month president reagan announced the sanctions in retaliation for what he called japan's failure to honour a july 1986 agreement to stop dumping computer microchips in markets outside the united states and to open its home market to american goods.     fukukawa said the united states had regrettably not listened to japan's explanation of its efforts to live up the pact and said washington had not given any detailed explanation of why it planned to impose the tariffs.  reuter ;","('trade',)","('trade',)"

""the ultimate question is not the price per share or the profit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct for those who would takeover an american company,"" said burlington lawyer humphrey.     burlington lawyers also contended that burlington, as the largest manufacturer of denim in the united states, would be in violation of anti-trust laws if it acquired dominion, canada's largest textile maker. dominion has denim manufacturing plants in georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market, the lawyers said.     samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. they said the market for denim is more fragmented than burlington contends and that burlington has the ability to switch between light weight and heavy weight denim production as demand and price dictate.     samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed by burlington in canada, in which it said it was considering a bid for dominion. ""surely, what would have been sauce for the goose would have been sauce for the gander,"" said sidney rosdeitcher, a samjens lawyer.  reuter ;","('acq',)","('acq',)"

24,"oecd sees major adjustment for australia australia faces a major medium term adjustment to reduce debt and improve its economic performance, the organisation for economic cooperation and development said in its latest annual review of the australian economy.     it said australia had a current external deficit of 5-3/4 pct of gross domestic product, high and rapidly rising external debt equal to 30 pct of gdp, growing servicing costs and inflation above nine pct, far higher than that of other oecd countries.     a major policy change in early 1985 helped lay the basis for sustained non-inflationary growth and external competitiveness had improved, but economic performance overall had sharply deteriorated since june 1985.     a major shift of real resources to the external sector -- about 4-1/2 pct of gdp by 1990-91 -- was required for the economy to expand in line with potential, for employment to grow, and for the debt/gdp ratio to stabilize, it said.     success depended on the setting of right policies including tighter fiscal policy, a reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement and on private sector behaviour.     looking ahead over the next 18 months, the oecd expected economic performance to improve, partly as a result of tighter fiscal and monetary policy, and a substantial improvement in trade volumes.     it said positive gdp growth of three pct might be restored, the current external deficit could fall to some 4-1/2 pct of gdp by the first half of next year, while inflation was projected to decelerate to around five to 5-1/2 pct by mid-1988.     continued real wage moderation was essential to maintain the competitive edge created by the australian dollar's depreciation, and to maintain if not boost profit shares in order to encourage business investment.     the report urged australia to broaden its export base by developing viable and competitive service and manufacturing industries, and not count on a recovery of commodity markets to correct its external imbalances.     it added australia should reduce protection levels in manufacturing, even though faster trade liberalisation would no doubt hurt the most protected sectors of industry.  reuter ;","('gnp',)","('trade',)"

""the offer still stands, we have not changed our offer,"" a bank of new york spokesman said.     irving would not comment on how the drop in the market affects its position on the bid or whether it would buy back any of its own shares.     earlier this month, irving rejected the bid as inadequate and said it wanted to retain its independence.     in late september, bank of new york offered 80 dlrs per share in cash for 47.4 pct of irving. for the remaining 52.6 pct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for one irving share.     at that time, the stock purchase portion was worth close to 80 dlrs per share, but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs per share for a net price of 68 dlrs, one analyst said.     according to the prospectus offer, shareholders may tender for all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis.     analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop would affect the acquisition.     ""if it gets to the irving shareholders, they would approve it, but irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,"" said mark alpert, banking analyst with bear stearns cos inc.     ""and the market is saying the deal won't go through,"" alpert said.     ""the transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed at present. if irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs a share, then they won't go at a lower price,"" another analyst said.     the analyst also doubted that bank of new york could afford to retain its original offer.     however, industry sources were more uncertain about prospects for the deal.     ""with irving's price so low, bank of new york's offer will look good to irving shareholders,"" said michael flores, a consultant at bank earnings international, a consulting firm.     the drop of irving's share to 44 dlrs per share, which is about a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increases the chance that bank of new york will succeed, flores said.     analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likely to depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the banking industry.     ""bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't use their own stock to make acquisitions because their share price is too depressed,"" alpert said.     since only banks can buy another bank, the only other possible acquirors would be a foreign bank, alpert said.

94,"falling soybean crush ratios cut output the sharp decline in soybean crush ratios seen in the last few weeks, accelerating in recent days, has pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean meal and oil.     the weekly u.s. soybean crush rate was reported by the national soybean processors association this afternoon at 21.78 mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over the past two months when crush margins surged to the best levels seen in over a year.     active soymeal export loadings at the gulf had pushed soybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in the weekly crush number.     however, much of that export demand seems to have been met, with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge in shipments of new crop south american soymeal over the next few months.     u.s. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder than normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in an attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said.     soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent weeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the nearby march contract today.     ""many speculators down here bought march soymeal and sold may, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow, which would cause march to gain on deferreds),"" one cbt crush trader said.     ""but they've been bailing out this week because the march has been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if not tomorrow, then later in the month,"" he added.     as a result of the weakness in soymeal, the march crush ratio (the value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans) fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per bushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two days.     the may crush ended today just over 17 cents, so no processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable level, the trader said. hopefully, they will now start to cut back production to get supplies in line with demand, he added.     with futures down, processors are finding they must bid premiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins.     a central illinois processor is only making about 30 cents for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, down sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below the average cost of production, cash dealers said.     most soybean processing plants are still in operation, with little talk of taking temporary down-time, so far. but processors will start halting production in the next few weeks it they continue to face unprofitable margins, they added.  reuter ;","('meal-feed', 'oilseed', 'soy-meal', 'soy-oil', 'soybean', 'veg-oil')","('oilseed', 'soybean')"

""you have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now, and that was well before plaza,"" he said.     on february 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at 263.15 yen. on september 20, the friday before plaza, it was 242. since then, despite massive bank of japan intervention and periodic market frights about further g-5 concerted action, the dollar trend has been down, down, down.     yet the ecu is now around 173.4 yen. the historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. the european currencies are moving back up against the yen.     the close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing. in 1986, japanese imports and exports with the ec both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen. this gave japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.     last january, japanese exports to the ec totalled half of of sales to the u.s, against about a third in recent years.     trade with the u.s in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms.     ""the basic meaning for europe is that japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to europe, where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important to them. suddenly, instead of the u.s., it is europe that is laying the golden egg,"" said de hora.     the ec is worried. ec business also had a remarkable year in japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base, compared with total japan-u.s. trade.     the japanese think ec firms are now more competitive than u.s. firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance, and which will cause problems.     ""this currency alignment between japan and the ec is reflecting the excellent performance of the ec countries. but therefore, japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge,"" said azusa hayashi, director of the first international economic affairs division of the foreign ministry. ""if you want my objective view, i don't expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance. last year, we asked for moderation in exports, and this year we may have to do so again,"" he said.  reuter... ;","('dlr', 'money-fx', 'yen')","('trade',)"

110,"imf urges belgium to make further spending cuts the belgian government, which introduced large-scale public spending reductions last year, has been told by an international monetary fund team there is scope for further cuts in 1988.     the suggestion is contained in the preliminary conclusions of the annual imf consultations with belgium on its economic policy, a copy of which was distributed to journalists at the weekly press conference following meetings of the cabinet.     the imf team also urges belgium to adopt a firm interest rate policy, with a particular emphasis on long-term rates.     the team's report to the government praises last year's spending cuts, which are due to reduce 1987 government spending by 195 billion francs, and says 1986 saw the belgian economy perform ""better, on a broader basis, than at any time so far in the 1980s.""     however, it adds that with lower inflation, stabilisation of the debt to gross national product ratio requires a much lower budget deficit than the seven pct of gnp target the government has set itself for 1989.     the government's net financing requirement was 11.0 pct of gnp in 1986.     the report says ""the most that can be afforded over the next few years is a zero growth of real non-interest expenditure of general government.""     it says there is a need for a revision of the belgian tax system to iron out distortions and meet hopes of a reduced tax burden but substantial progress is needed in stabilising the debt to gnp ratio before this is possible.     ""because of the difficulty of sustaining zero expenditure growth and of likely growing impatience (for) tax reductions, we feel that your position would be stronger if you could decide on rather sharp expenditure reductions in 1988,"" the report adds.     the imf urges a strong interest rate policy to signal the government's determination to keep its currency strong and to curb inflation.     it says firmer long-term rates would slow private net long-term capital outflows, which increased strongly in 1986.     it also urges net repayments of foreign currency debt and an overhaul of domestic capital markets to facilitate the subscriptions by non-residents of government bond issues in belgian francs.  reuter ;","('gnp', 'interest')","('gnp',)"

139,"hungary hopes devaluation will end trade deficit national bank of hungary first vice-president janos fekete said he hoped a planned eight pct devaluation of the forint will spur exports and redress last year's severe trade deficit with the west.     fekete told reuters in an interview hungary must achieve at least equilibrium on its hard currency trade.     ""it is useful to have a devaluation,"" he said. ""there is now a real push to our exports and a bit of a curb to our imports.""     the official news agency mti said today hungary would devalue by eight pct and it expected the new rates to be announced later today. fekete said the rates would come into effect tomorrow.     he said one reason for the devaluation was that hungary had a higher rate of inflation over the past two years than its main partners (around eight pct in 1985 and between five and 5.5 pct in 1986).     this was partly an after-effect of action hungary took to prevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks of the 1970s, he added.     hungary devalued by a similar amount last september and by between three and four pct early last year.     but the country's hard currency trade balance nevertheless fell into a deficit of 539.4 mln dlrs from a surplus of 295.3 mln in 1986 and 1.2 billion in 1985.     fekete said hungary was hoping for a hard currency trade surplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year, but that a more likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on total hard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs.     one western commercial attache here said: ""devaluation of itself will not change anything. it will only be useful if they also make efforts to restructure industry and improve the quality of their export goods.""     fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms this year to invest in restructuring industry.     it would be his role to persuade international banks to cooperate in this process. he noted hungary had been given an aa rating enabling it to raise money on the japanese samurai bond market.     hungary's net hard currency debt soared to 7.79 billion dlrs last year from 5.01 billion in 1985, partly because of a current account deficit of 1.42 billion dlrs and partly because the fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debt denominated in marks or yen.     he said he feared net debt would also rise slightly this year, but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose of modernisation.     ""i am for credits to invest for that purpose,"" he said. ""i am against credits for consumption."" he forecast gross domestic product growth of two pct this year, from one pct in 1986.    fekete said hungary would continue to restructure its debt profile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium term loans with cheaper long term money for which it was looking more and more to the fixed interest rate bond market, where he considered rates to be low.     hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay at around 3.5 billion dlrs, he said. on the budget deficit, which tripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year after quadrupling in 1985, fekete said the finance ministry was working out measures to reduce an approved target deficit for this year of 43.8 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billion forints.  reuter ;","('cpi', 'money-fx', 'reserves', 'trade')","('trade',)"

""i don't know who in congress would propose that happening. politically it would be totally unacceptable,"" an aide to a senior farm-state senator said.     usda undersecretary daniel amstutz said this week that congress should give usda authority to keep the soybean loan  at its current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel rather than increasing it to its minimum allowed level of 4.77 dlrs.     ""i'm convinced that congress will not go along with this,"" american soybean association president dave haggard said.     amstutz told reporters following a senate hearing that if the soybean loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, usda could then consider ways to make u.s. soybeans more competitive.     his comments were seen as possibly indicating what the  the administration's position is in the debate over what should be done to make soybeans competitive and at the same time protect soybean farmers' income.     using soybean specific certificates to further buydown the loan rate or implementation of a marketing loan have been pointed to as the most effective ways to get soybean prices competitive. usda secretary richard lyng, however, continues to maintain his opposition to a marketing loan, saying such a move would be too costly.

""the losses for 1987 are expected to be substantially less than in 1986,"" first city chairman j.a. elkins said in a letter included in the annual report.

""the company still faces uncertainties in the real estate market and anticipates further deterioration in the pportfolio so long as the regional recession persists,"" first city said.

263,"bank of japan satisfied with yen at current range the bank of japan is satisfied with the yen around its current range, a senior central bank official told reporters.     he said the pledge by major industrial nations in paris last month to cooperate to hold exchange rates around current ranges applied in both directions, a dollar fall or a dollar rise.     unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currency stability, but it can be useful when coordinated with other policies and with other central banks, he said.     the bank of japan is rather confident currency stability will continue for some time, the senior bank official said, but declined to be more specific.     finance minister kiichi miyazawa told parliament on friday the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily satisfactory for the japanese economy.     asked what factors might destabilize the markets, the official cited a lessening of market fear about intervention, a completely unexpected change in the economy of japan, the u.s. or west germany, or resumption of comments by government officials seeking to talk the dollar up or down.     the senior bank official said he expects japan's gross national product (gnp) to grow three pct or slightly more in the fiscal year beginning in april. that would be little changed from the performance expected this year.     domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987/88, but the external sector will have a negative impact on gnp of nearly one percentage point, he said.     he said there was virtually no room for further monetary policy action to boost the economy. the economy's performance in the future very much depends on fiscal policy, he added.     the central bank's monetary policy has already done its part in stimulating the economy, the senior bank official said. the bank of japan has cut its discount rate five times over the last year and a half.     although the central bank does not see any imminent risk of inflation, there could be some problems in the future, he said. ""we are sitting on a barrel of powder, but fortunately it may still be wet,"" he added.     liquidity among private households and especially the corporate sector has increased substantially, he said.     the liquidity is the reason for the recent boom of stock exchange prices, the bank official said. this inflow of funds into the stock exchange, occurring also in other countries, may continue, he said.     the senior official said the bank of japan is hoping federal reserve chairman paul volcker will be re-appointed when his current term expires later this year.     ""he's a great man,"" the official said, adding that more and more people expect his reappointment.     turning to exchange rates, the official said the substantial drop in the dollar is beginning to have an effect on reducing the imbalance in world trade, even though the impact has taken longer than expected to show through. even the u.s. trade position has begun to feel the impact, although so far it has not been very strong, he said.  reuter ;","('gnp', 'money-fx', 'yen')","('money-fx',)"

""growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no gain,"" the report says.     ""the modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil and palm kernels.""     constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the report underlines.     the fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as ""wereng"" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields.     the outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more resistant rice types.     the government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices.     palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the report says.     but while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (oct-sept) will rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant.     the report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last september""s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand.     the report said that indonesia""s overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s. it compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct in 1984.     the dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump.  reuter ;","('coffee', 'copra-cake', 'corn', 'cotton', 'grain', 'palm-oil', 'palmkernel', 'plywood', 'rice', 'rubber', 'soy-meal', 'soybean', 'sugar', 'tea', 'veg-oil', 'wheat')","('grain', 'rice')"
292,"krupp has satisfactory 1986 results the fried. krupp gmbh <krpg.d> steel and engineering group said it had a satisfactory 1986 despite a provisional 12 pct fall in total group sales to 18.1 billion marks from 20.7 billion the previous year.     third party turnover declined to 15.9 billion from 18.5 billion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15.5 billion marks from 16.9 billion, it said in a preliminary statement.     despite these figures, which reflected the dollar's weakness against the mark and oil and raw materials price falls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year.     the reason was the continued expansion of the machinery and plant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales.     krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineering business achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions had underpinned machinery and component activities.     an orders decline in the steel and, in particular, the trading and services sectors, affected the group's total order figures.     however, ""all business sectors contributed to the positive results achieved in 1986,"" krupp added, without giving details.     domestic orders decreased by five pct to 9.6 billion marks from the previous year and foreign orders fell 14 pct to 5.9 billion, it said. foreign business accounted for 38 pct of orders against 40 pct in 1985.     orders received by the machinery and plant sector, 11 member companies which comprise the core area of the group, rose by four mln marks last year to 6.9 billion, krupp said.     the group's orders in hand amounted to 9.1 billion marks at end-december 1986 from 10.3 billion at the start of the year.     orders received by the steel sector last year decreased by three pct to 6.2 billion marks from 1985, it said.     the steel market weakened increasingly over the year, mainly because of exchange rate movements, the deterioration in foreign trade and a downturn in a number of customer industries.     the difficult market for sections and flats of quality steel depressed order tonnages by around seven pct, krupp said. but special steel boosted by strong demand for stainless cold-rolled flats, grew by five pct in tonnage terms.  reuter ;","('earn',)","('iron-steel',)"

301,"colombia coffee exporters believe in pragmatism private coffee exporters say colombia's more pragmatic coffee marketing policy will ensure that the country does not suffer excessively from current depressed prices and erratic market conditions.     gilberto arango, president of the exporters' association, said in an interview that colombia, the world's second largest producer, was in a position to withstand a prolonged absence of international coffee organization (ico) export quotas.     ""colombia is one of the countries that will benefit most from this situation,"" he said.     recent ico talks in london failed to break a deadlock over re-introduction of export quotas, suspended in february 1986, and no date has been set for a new meeting on the issue.     arango said that government measures adopted here last week, including a lower export registration price, indicated a major change but also disclosed a welcome pragmatism.     ""this is the start of a new era in colombia because world market conditions are also new,"" he said.     the government lowered local taxes for exporters and said the export registration price, or reintegro, will be changed more often in order to closely reflect market trends.     arango said an illustration of colombia's new attitude was the decision on friday to open export registrations for an unlimited amount.     but he added it did not imply the country would begin heavy selling of coffee.     ""our marketing policy is to sell without haste but consistently. no targets for volume will be set. we will react to market factors adequately and colombia has no intention of giving its coffee away.""     colombia's past records should be the basis for upcoming exports, he said.     ""we will certainly not export seven mln (60-kilo) bags but neither are we going to sell like mad. the trade knows full well what colombia's export potential is,"" he said.     colombia, with stockpiles standing at about 10 mln bags, exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year which ended last september, and 11.3 mln in calendar 1986.     arango did not want to commit himself on export predictions but said that output for the 1986/87 coffee year would not exceed 10.5 mln bags, compared with 12 mln forecast by the national coffee growers' federation and 12.5 mln by the u.s. department of agriculture, a figure he said was ""ridiculous.""     he said ageing plantations and rust, in particular in the number one producing province of antioquia, meant output was likely to fall but that nationwide estimates were rare and oscillated between 9.5 mln and 11.5 mln bags.     on the failure of the recent ico talks, arango said colombia understandably felt frustrated at not having managed to force a compromise.     jorge cardenas, manager of the national federation and head of his nation's delegation in london, has blamed the intransigence of some big countries, without naming them.     however, arango, like colombian finance minister cesar gaviria last week, was more explicit and said the united states would undoubtedly be under great political pressure in coming weeks to revise its policy.     ""washington will have to take into account that for many countries, and some of its allies for instance in central america, a sharp fall in coffee export revenue would have far-reaching political and economic consequences.""     arango ruled out a fresh colombian initiative on export quotas saying producers had now to show a common resolve which could emerge from continuous contacts.  reuter ;","('coffee',)","('coffee',)"

304,"japan isolated, yen rises, world feels cheated japan is becoming dangerously isolated again as the u.s. and europe feel they have been cheated by japanese promises to switch from export to domestic-led growth, officials and businessmen from around the world said.     as the dollar today slipped to a record low below 145 yen, making japanese exporters and holders of dollar investments grit their teeth harder, finance minister kiichi miyazawa said there was a perception japan had reneged on its promise.     the problem goes deep and centres on misunderstandings by both sides over the key maekawa report of april, last year.     the document was prepared by a private committee formed by prime minister yasuhiro nakasone and led by former bank of japan head haruo maekawa. it recommended that to stop friction due to its large trade surpluses, japan must ""make a historical transformation in its traditional policies on economic management and the nation's lifestyle. there can be no further development for japan without this transformation.""     americans and europeans took the report to heart and have looked in vain for clear signs of this historic change. but the japanese remain doubtful about the short, or even medium term prospects of totally transforming their economic habits.     the bubble of frustration against what appears as japanese prevarication burst last week. the u.s. said it intended to raise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on japanese exports to the u.s. on the grounds japan had abrogated a bilateral semiconductor pact.     british prime minister margaret thatcher threatened to block japanese financial firms from london after the japanese placed what the british say are restrictive conditions on a bid by british firm cable and wireless to join a domestic telecommunications joint venture.     on friday, european currency dealers said european central banks, annoyed at restrictive japanese trade practises, might leave japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen.     eishiro saito, head of top japanese business group keidanren, spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory views last november when he visited the european community. ""related to this matter of (trade) imbalance, the point that i found to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to europe was the excessive degree of hope placed by the europeans in the results of the maekawa report,"" he said.     ""we explained that the process of restructuring the economy away from its dependence on exports toward a balance between domestic and external demand...would take time,"" saito said.     saito's words were ignored. in february, ec industrial policy director heinrich von moltke came to japan and said ""i only know that your government, under the leadership of maekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a less outward looking, more inward looking one. it is the maekawa report which has attracted the most attention in europe.""     and europeans and americans want quick action. ""a far better answer than protectionism would be structural change within the japanese economy, the kind suggested by the maekawa report. and we hope to see changes occur in the near future,"" visiting chairman of general motors roger smith said in march.     such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly the fault of nakasone, who heralded maekawa's report as a sea of change in japanese affairs, said u.s. officials.     months before the report was issued, u.s. and ec business leaders met their japanese colleagues to discuss the trade problem.     ""we are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the maekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,"" said ec industrial union leader lord ray pennock.     ""the important implication of the maekawa report is that it is finally looking to let japanese enjoy the fruits of their labour,"" said philip caldwell, senior managing director of shearson lehman brothers.     contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance.     japanese officials say they are implementing the report as fast as they can, said a european ambassador who has travelled the country asking about this issue.     he said people mentioned many things in line with the spirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal and steel industries.     a major misunderstanding is that the private report was government policy. europeans are confused about this, underlined by von moltke's reference to the ""leadership"" of the maekawa report. even so, japanese officials point to last september's government programme of new economic measures. ""without endorsing the report as policy, officials point out that the government has put its signature to a programme designed to implement the report,"" the ambassador said.  reuter ;","('dlr', 'money-fx', 'yen')","('trade',)"

309,"german financial policy makers in rare dissension karl otto poehl, head of west germany's central bank, and finance minister gerhard stoltenberg are normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the central bank's independence.     but a rare public row between the ebullient poehl, president of the bundesbank, and stoltenberg, over a controversial investment tax proposal, has added to the woes of the country's already nervous financial markets, bankers said.     poehl told an investment symposium in frankfurt last thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and interest rates     stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting poehl's criticism, saying west germany would remain an attractive place for foreign investors.     ""the obvious lack of coordination between the bundesbank and finance ministry does not instil confidence in foreign investors,"" said one economist for a london broker, who asked not to be identified.     bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial policy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship to steer the economy through a particularly difficult time.     ""there are plenty of objective pressures which will result in things getting back to normal again after a period of ill feeling,"" said commerzbank ag chief economist juergen pfister.     news on october 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in a market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and abroad.     bankers said the bundesbank was angered by the way the finance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting the bundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflicting details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market.     both poehl, 57, and stoltenberg, 59, have been under extraordinary pressures lately.     poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his deputy, helmut schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fight inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had pursued so far this year to promote currency stability.     in recent statements poehl has sounded more like schlesinger. for years the softly-spoken economist has been warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply growth would eventually lead to rising prices.     schlesinger now has a majority of support in the bundesbank council, and since late summer poehl has had to represent his views, bankers said.     ""poehl is in a minority in his own house,"" said commerzbank's pfister.     ""poehl is in a dilemma. he must follow a policy that is not entirely his own,"" said another economist.     the dilemma is that if german interest rates rise too far, they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark and hurting west german exporters.     the dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the bundesbank's new tack became clear in early october.     since last thursday, united states treasury secretary james baker has criticized the bundesbank rate increases.     bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986 war of words between the u.s. and west germany, in which u.s. officials talked down the dollar to force west germany to stimulate its economy and thus suck in more u.s. exports.     one way west germany agreed to do this was making a round of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.     but financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for stoltenberg than he had bargained for.     the cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted most popular government politician last year, had to face resistance from local barons in the government coalition parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.     the withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising 4.3 billion marks.     but it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will push up borrowing costs. the extra amount this costs the government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.     meanwhile stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row which has turned into the country's worst political scandal.     stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in washington last month early to sort out a row in the northern state of schleswig-holstein, where he heads the ruling cdu party.     the state's cdu premier, uwe barschel, had to resign after allegations of a ""dirty tricks"" election campaign led to heavy losses for the cdu in state elections.     barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in geneva last weekend. police say the death appears to have been suicide.     cooperation between poehl and stoltenberg is all the more remarkable as poehl is in the opposition social democrats, and was appointed by former chancellor helmut schmidt.     when poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this year, chancellor helmut kohl's cdu-led coalition government gave poehl another eight-year term.     werner chrobok, managing partner at bethmann bank, said he hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.     but when poehl criticized stoltenberg's tax plans he was not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the bundesbank's independence of government, chrobok said.  reuter ;","('interest', 'money-fx')","('money-fx',)"

431,"gaf <gaf> seen raising borg-warner <bor> bid gaf corp, set on acquiring borg-warner corp's valuable plastics business, is believed by analysts to be preparing an increased offer for the chicago-based company.      yesterday, borg-warner said it agreed to be acquired for 4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by merrill lynch capital partners. merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for 89 pct of borg-warner's common stock, and a package of cash and securities for the balance.     borg-warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8.     ""i think it's (the stock price) telling us gaf is coming in with another bid,"" said one analyst, who values the company at 51 or 52 dlrs per share.     gaf has offered 46 dlrs per share. it holds 19.9 pct of borg-warner's stock.     ""you're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to up the price. obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you have to. i think gaf is looking at the company the way we're looking at it - that it's worth more,"" pershing and co analyst richard henderson said.     henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share.     gaf has only said it was reviewing the situation. merrill lynch officials did not return phone calls.     analysts have said they believe gaf chairman samuel heyman sought borg-warner because of its chemicals and plastics business. the rigid plastics are used in such things as telephones, computer terminals, and appliances.     ""where the heck can you buy a world class chemical operation these days,"" said henderson.     ""he's (heyman's) got the bucks. he's a heavy hitter, and he does not like to get pushed around,"" said henderson.     gaf, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeover of the much larger union carbide corp two years ago. while gaf did not win the company, it made a substantial gain on its investment in carbide.     analysts said gaf already has a large profit built into its borg-warner holdings. they said even if gaf raises its offer and does not succeed, a higher bid from another company would give gaf millions of dollars in profits on its stock.     ""it's a win-win situation,"" said one analyst.     one analyst speculated an offer from gaf would be forthcoming shortly.     ""i think we are finally down to the final paragraph in this book,"" he said.     borg-warner's other businesses include automotive parts, protective services, which includes wells fargo security guards, and chilton corp, a credit rating service.     charles rose, an oppenheimer and co analyst who follows gaf, said if gaf were to sell into the merrill lynch offer, it would realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 per share.     ""i think there's a probability he goes up in price,"" said rose.     rose said, however, he could not really predict what heyman would do. ""sam's a low-risk, high-return player.""     ""is he trying to build a major industrial chemical enterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank,"" rose said.     analysts said borg-warner's chemical business would add earnings momentum to gaf. ""i worked out that paying as much as 50 dlrs per share would still be additive to gaf in time, if they sold off most of the non-chemical facilities,"" said john henry of e.f. hutton.     borg-warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986 operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billion dlrs. total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and net earnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986.

448,"oecd trade, growth seen slowing in 1987 the 24 nations of the organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd), hampered by sluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic growth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into deficit in 1987, the economist intelligence unit (eiu ) said.     the eiu said in its world trade forecast it revised oecd economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a 2.8 pct growth forecast in december.     it said the new areas of weakness are west germany and the smaller european countries it influences, and japan, hardest hit by currency appreciation this year.     the independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth rate forecasts for west germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in december and to 2.3 pct from three pct for japan.     it said it expected the oecd to post a current account deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.     it said the u.s. current account deficit looked likely to fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in 1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.     it said it expected west germany to post a 31 billion dlr payments surplus and japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.     the eiu said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50 dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18 dlrs last year, as adherence to opec output policy becomes increasingly ragged.     it said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last year's 18.4 pct drop. the average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.     ""this is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather than a three-point landing,"" the eiu said.     ""talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the february meeting (of finance ministers of the group of five and canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to more expansive policies in west germany and japan, or a tighter u.s. fsical policy,"" it said.     it said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the willingness of japanese institutions to buy u.s. government assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.     ""thus far they have been willing,"" the eic said, adding that if japan was deterred from buying u.s. bonds the dollar would collapse.     to contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates would have to soar, bringing recession and a third world debt crisis, it said.     on trade, the eiu said prospects for 1987 look ""increasingly sick.""     import growth, forecast in december at 4.5 pct, is now seen slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to 4.2 pct in 1988, it said.     the weakness of the west german economy is the biggest single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in december, the eiu said.     on the export side, it said it saw weak demand in west germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in europe, while japan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by u.s. exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more competitively-priced dollar.     it said in most of europe and in japan, raw materials and oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986.  reuter ;","('bop', 'dlr', 'gnp', 'trade')","('trade',)"
449,"fed data suggest u.s. credit policy is on hold latest federal reserve data suggest that the u.s. banking system is flush with reserves going into a period of traditional tightness and that overall monetary policy is on hold, economists said.     ""there is ample liquidity.... the fed is not going to shift gears at the present time or for at least another month,"" said maria ramirez of drexel burnham lambert inc.     ""technical and seasonal considerations aside, there is nothing for the (credit) market to get excited about,"" added robert di clemente of salomon brothers inc.     adjusted bank borrowings from the fed's discount window averaged only 228 mln dlrs a day in the first week of the bank statement period ending next wednesday, compared with 233 mln and 451 mln in the first weeks of the previous two periods.     another sign of abundant liquidity was the upward revision in banks' net free reserves in the two-week period to march 11 to a daily average of 759 mln dlrs from an estimated 660 mln.     finally, a fed spokesman told a press briefing that the 14 money center banks were absent from the fed's discount window for the third week running, with the latest week's borrowing split between the large regional and the smaller banks.     while modest open market intervention was apparently enough to defuse any funding pressures in the first week of the latest statement period, economists predicted that the fed would have to be more aggressive in coming weeks.     the fed injected temporary reserves directly and indirectly on four of the five trading days via system and customer repurchase agreements.     ""fed funds will be coming under relatively intense pressure,"" said salomon's di clemente, noting the approaching month- and quarter-end and the round of holidays and tax dates in april.     ""the fed is faced with a large seasonal adding requirement,"" said ward mccarthy of merrill lynch and co inc, who expects a permanent bill purchase next week and a coupon purchase in early april.     economists were also heartened by further signs of a deceleration in money supply growth, not only in the largely discredited m-1 gauge but also in the more closely watched m-2 and m-3 aggregates.     m-1 grew a mere 500 mln dlrs in the week to march nine, compared with private forecasts of a 2.3 mln dlr rise. weekly m-2 and m-3 components also hinted at slower overall growth.     ""the m-1 increase was surprisingly modest and i suspect we are on our way to another moderate set of m-2 and m-3 figures for march,"" said salomon's di clemente. merrill's mccarthy said they could even come in below the bottom of their respective target ranges.     in february, m-2 was 18.2 billion dlrs below its upper limit and m-3 was 20.8 billion beneath.     noting fed vice chairman johnson's encouraging remarks on inflation today and recent interest rate cuts overseas, some economists suggested this slowing in monetary growth could lend support to calls for further accommodation here.     ""our belief is that we could still get a move downwards in rates before anything else,"" said salomon's di clemente, adding that the key swing factor will continue to be the strength of the u.s. economy.     jeffrey leeds of chemical bank agreed that the economy's health would remain the main influence on policy but, contrary to di clemente, he said that recent signs of faster growth and inflation could lead to higher rates first.     drexel's ramirez did not commit herself either way, adding that the next major move may have to wait until april 14 when february's u.s. trade data are due for release.  reuter ;","('interest', 'money-supply')","('money-supply',)"

""next year, block could have a bonanza,"" buchbinder said. based on estimates of a larger work force, block could show a gain of more than five pct in tax forms prepared, he said. in the 1986 tax season, block prepared 9,215,300 u.s. tax returns, up 1.5 pct over the previous year.     the internal revenue service estimates about 100 mln individual income tax returns will be filed for the 1987 tax season, up from last year's 94 mln forms. professional tax preparers accounted for just over 43 million forms, according to the irs.     for the longer term, while confusion will continue to bring clients into block's 8,866 tax preparation offices worldwide, there are some changes in the act that will have a negative effect, bloch conceded.     certain changes in filing requirements will shorten the tax return, and in some cases, simplify the form, he noted. in addition, some low income wage earners will be taken off the tax rolls, he said.     block is currently analyzing its price structure to try to offset some of the negatives. last tax season, the average cost for each return in the u.s. amounted to 48.05 dlrs and 45.73 dlrs worldwide, bloch said. this tax season, rates will be up about three or four pct, in line with the inflation rate, he said.     block expects ""some expansion"" this tax season of its electronic filing system which directly feeds into the irs and can speed up the refund process. block can choose where and by how much it wants to expand into the seven cities made available for the direct filing by the irs, bloch noted.     the irs estimates about 90,000 returns will be directly filed this tax season, up from the 26,000 returns injected in the 1986 tax season.     first kansas city analyst jonathan braatz said that block will benefit greatly from lower tax rates in fiscal 1988.     braatz expects block's advertising budget to be about the same as last year which will be helped a bit by lower costs for television ads.

458,"pesch sees shareholder support in ami <ami> bid chicago physician leroy pesch said he has had discussions with several american medical international inc shareholders and sees support for a restructuring of the company.     pesch said he has discussed his sweetened, 1.91 billion dlr takeover bid for american medical with several large shareholders, including the biggest investor, the bass family of texas. however, the bass family has not indicated support one way or the other for his offer, he said.     pesch, in an interview with reuters, said based on the conversations he held with shareholders, he could not guage whether he had majority support. he said, however, there is support for his offer.     pesch would not identify shareholders with whom he held discussions other than the bass family and the wedge group inc, the only other holder of more than five pct of american medical stock.     earlier today, wedge group, which has a 5.5 pct stake,  said it held discussions with pesch, american medical management and other american medical shareholders.     wedge, in a filing with the securities and exchange commission, said it believes a restructuring of american medical and its business would be ""highly desirable and appropriate at this time.""     ""that's the sort of position that i find a large segment of shareholders of ami really share,"" said pesch.     pesch said he held discussions with wedge about joining his takeover effort, in which he is offering 17 dlrs cash, four dlrs in preferred stock and one dlr in common stock for each american medical share. wedge said it has no plans to join in an effort to seek control of american medical, but it would not rule out a future takeover try.     pesch said he did not discuss a joint takeover proposal with the bass family.     some analysts saw the wedge statement as a boost to pesch's takeover effort and a further sign that there could be some shareholder dissatisfaction following american medical's previous rejection of a 20 dlr per share all cash offer from pesch.     american medical is expected to resist pesch's latest bid. larry feinberg, an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc said a management-led leveraged buyout cannot be ruled out.     an american medical spokesman said the company will comment on the new pesch offer by march 10.     analysts continue to view the bass family as a factor in the outcome of the bid for control of american medical.     the bass family holds an 11. 6 pct stake in american medical, and the company has previously said the investors support management's internal plan to improve the company's performance. the bass family would not comment on american medical or pesch.     pesch, who led the leveraged buyout of republic health corp last year, continues to face a credibilty problem on wall street because of the long time it took to finish the republic acquisition.     republic also has substantial debt, and has left wall street questioning whether financing can be completed for the much larger american medical takeover proposal.     pesch's first offer for american medical was made without an investment banking firm, another cause for concern to wall street. however, pesch entered his second offer with representation from donaldson, lufkin, and jenrette securities and security pacific merchant banking group.     ""i don't have any doubt that the current transaction can be worked out and completed, provided we get to the point where ami management will sit down and talk in a friendly environment,"" pesch said.     pesch would not elaborate on what type of financing arrangements are being made. he did say if he succeeds in acquiring american medical he plans to keep much of american medical management in place.     he said he plans to combine the company with republic to form an efficient network of hospitals.     analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer could be made for american medical.     byron nimocks of e.f. hutton group said improved second fiscal quarter earnings could make american medical stock worth about 20 dlrs per share.     nimocks estimates american medical earnings for the second quarter ended february 28 could be 35 cts, compared to a 95 ct loss last year.     nimocks said pesch's revised offer is not worth much more than the 20 dlrs cash offered previously.     but feinberg said there is a better chance a transaction could be completed because of the revised structure of the offer. ""i think it's much more doable,"" he said.     analysts have said american medical has begun a turnaround by replacing some members of management and reducing costs.  reuter ;","('acq',)","('acq',)"

479,"around 3.5 mln acres said to be idled by 0/92 a 0/92 program would have very little impact on u.s. acreage, prompting farmers to idle only an additional 3.5 mln acres of cropland every year, according to a report from the agriculture department.     the savings resulting from the additional 3.5 mln acres idled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings, 35 mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings, and 10-20 mln dlrs per year in deficiency payment savings, the report said.     the usda report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 0/92 acreage program for wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum and barley. last year, almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested.     ""the likelihood that the 0-92 provisiion will cause very large acreages to be removed from crop production is quite small,"" the report said.     ""the returns on typical farms still favor participation in the usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permitted acreage,"" the usda report said.     the 0/92 program, which would allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment, would be most used by producers in high production/high risk areas where cost of production is high, said keith collins, director of usda's economics analysis staff.     ""in the heart of the corn belt, you would not get that much participation,"" collins said.     usda estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheat would be ildled under 0/92, 1.5 mln acres of corn, 500,000 acres of sorghum and barley and 500,000 acres of cotton.     production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40 mln bushels of wheat, 180 mln bushels of corn, 20 mln bushels of sorghum, 10 mln bushels of barley, and 500,000 bales of cotton, the report said.     ""in determining whether to participate, a producer would need to weigh the expected cash costs of production against the loan rate ... the risk that market prices may rise above the expected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must be considered,"" according to the analysis.     ""what you're giving up under 0/92 is the difference between the loan rate and the cost of production,"" collins said.     for producers with low production costs, that difference is greater and can be applied to paying variable costs, he said. under these cicumstances, farmers would not want to go along with 0/92. but for high cost producers, 0/92 would be more attractive.     also, as loan rates get lower, collins said there would be more incentives to participate in a 0/92 program.     ""i would admit that its impacts would be very marginal at first, but it is a step towards the goal of separating production decisions from government payments,"" collins said.     in a speech earlier today before the national grains and feed association, usda secretary richard lyng said it is too late to implement 0/92 for 1987 crops since program signup will be over by the end of this month.  reuter ;","('barley', 'corn', 'cotton', 'grain', 'sorghum', 'wheat')","('grain', 'wheat')"

484,"china faces dilemma over sugar imports china has to decide if it will increase sugar imports this year to cover falling domestic output and rising demand, in view of market predictions that international sugar prices will remain firm this year, traders and the official press said.     he kang, minister of agriculture, animal husbandry and fisheries, said this week that china has adjusted the purchasing price for sugar cane and beet to check a drop in production last year but he gave no price details.     one japanese trader said domestic demand is rising rapidly because of improving living standards and rising demand for sweet drinks, cakes and biscuits and other sugary foods.     ""it will not be easy to cut domestic demand, even in a state-controlled economy. china may have to import,"" he said.     customs figures show imports fell to 1.182 mln tonnes in 1986 from 1.909 mln in 1985 and fell to 25,165 tonnes in january 1987 from 54,000 in january 1986.     the official economic information newspaper last month said production in the 1986/87 crushing season (september-april) will be 1.18 mln tonnes short of demand.     the paper put 1986/87 output at 4.82 mln, down from 5.24 mln in 1985/86, and domestic demand at about six mln tonnes.     ""in the last two years, acreage under sugar cane and beet has fallen, sugar mills are underutilised, output has dropped and cannot meet demand that is rising every day,"" it said.     ""the country will have to continue imports of sugar and draw down stocks to meet market demand,"" it added.     it quoted the ministry of light industry as blaming the drop in output on unreasonable state purchasing prices for cane and beet as against other crops, which has resulted in farmers refusing to grow them.     the paper said in 1985 a farmer could earn up to three times more per hectare from pineapple and watermelon and up to seven times more from bananas than from sugarcane. he could sell grain on the free market at 560 yuan a tonne, against only 70 yuan a tonne for sugarcane.     sugar mills are suffering because refined sugar prices have not changed for 20 years despite rising costs, it said.     in fujian, the cost of producing one tonne rose to 702 yuan in 1985 from 520.1 in 1980, cutting the mills' profit to 117 yuan a tonne from 217.9, it added.     the paper said unreasonable pricing resulted in 144 of the 442 sugar mills working in the 1985/86 crushing season losing money. china has 521 sugar mills.     a foreign agricultural expert forecast a drop in cane acreage in 1986/87 (september-august) of up to 10 pct in guangdong, which produced 45 pct of china's sugar in calendar 1985, and a smaller drop in fujian, which produced 11 pct of china's sugar in calendar 1985.     he said both provinces are more developed than other sugar-producing areas and more sensitive to demand from cities.     but cane acreage in guangxi and yunnan, which accounted for 28 pct of the 1985 crop, has risen by 10 to 30 pct in 1986/87, because cane-growing is more economic there, he said.     he put sugar stocks at 2.333 mln tonnes in september 1986.     a hong kong trader estimated stocks at more than three mln at end-january. ""now they are falling but (they) have not reached the critical level, compelling china to import quickly,"" he said.     ""china has options not easily available in western countries. it controls stocks strictly and can release less into the consumer market if stocks fall too quickly,"" he said.     the hong kong trader said calendar 1987 imports will be slightly less than those of 1986, because of firm world prices and serious foreign exchange constraints which, he said, are likely to continue until at least end-1988.     he said nearly all cane and beet is sold to the state-owned mills, with a small amount sold raw to consumers.     ""most of the mills are old and inefficient, with many of them using soviet equipment imported in the 1950s,"" he said.     he said demand in rural areas will in future rise an annual four pct, with demand in the cities rising an annual two pct.  reuter ;","('sugar',)","('sugar',)"

487,"brazil's gros to meet banks on trade line issue brazil's central bank governor francisco gros will meet senior commercial bankers here today in a new attempt to defuse the anger generated by the country's unilateral suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign commercial bank debt, bankers said.     gros will meet representatives of citibank, the head of brazil's bank advisory committee, and of co-heads morgan guaranty trust co and lloyds bank plc.     high on the agenda will be banks' complaints about brazil's accompanying freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short-term trade and interbank lines, the bankers said.     brazil's several hundred creditor banks worldwide agreed last march to extend the credit lines until march 31, 1987, as part of a 31 billion dlr financing package.     bankers said the looming expiry of this commitment, coupled with brazil's freeze, raised a spate of technical and legal questions that the banks want to discuss with gros.     they said they face problems because of the freeze requirement that any payment due to be made by a brazilian bank under the trade facility must be deposited instead with the central bank. this means foreign bankers cannot easily switch their credit lines from one borrower to another.     the requirement to deposit with the central bank has also meant brazilian banks have been able to negotiate lower interest-rate spreads, because foreign banks would rather accept a reduced margin than see their money deposited with the central bank.     ""it's caused a lot of ill-will with the banking community,"" one banker said.     gros is also expected to brief the banks on the results of a 10-day tour of europe and japan that he and finance minister dilson funaro have just completed to seek official support for brazil's debt stance.  reuter ;","('interest',)","('interest',)"
488,"royal trust plots aggressive global expansion <royal trustco ltd>, in a move unique among canadian trust companies, is pursuing a bold global expansion that could someday lift the foreign share of its yearly earnings to 50 pct, president michael cornelissen said.     first marathon securities ltd financial services analyst michael walsh said royal trust's international growth target is attainable. but it ""will be a tremendous achievement because ... they're going to have to build an international earnings base larger than the earnings of a lot of significant domestic trust companies,"" walsh said.     global operations, which made up 22 pct of royal trust's 154 mln dlr 1986 net profit, will post 33 pct profit growth this year against an expected 15 pct jump in total company profit, cornelissen told reuters in an interview.     he said the foreign share of total profit would rise to 26 pct in 1987 and to 44 pct by 1990.     royal trust, canada's second largest trust company with assets of about 19.54 billion canadian dlrs, has operated internationally since 1929 when it opened a london bank.     its aggressive global strategy began in the 1980s, when other canadian trusts, the equivalent of u.s. savings and loans, were focusing on domestic retail banking.     the company's overseas ambitions were whetted by heightened domestic competition and impressive growth at its london bank operations, which attained full british banking powers in 1980, cornelissen said.     last year, royal trust moved into continental europe and asia with its 239 mln canadian dlr acquisition of dow chemical co <dow>'s dow financial services corp, which included asset management, merchant and private banking companies.     ""it was a heaven-sent opportunity,"" cornelissen said of the dow financial acquisition. ""we achieved in one year what would otherwise have taken five to 10 years to set up.""     cornelissen stressed that royal trust would shun direct competition with major global financial institutions in activities such as international lending and stock brokerage, in order to exploit ""profitable niches"" overseas in traditional trust activities such as asset management, private banking and advisory services.     he said that royal trust hoped to complete negotiations ""before the end of this month"" to sell its london-based savory milln brokerage, acquired in the dow financial deal.     ""the international market is so big and we have such a miniscule share of it that growth opportunities are really limited only by our energy and our desire to find more business,"" he said, adding that in trust-type services, ""we don't think the international markets are well-served.""     aiding royal trust's foreign growth are greater foreign  investment interest in north america and increased canadian investment abroad, cornelissen said.     central to royal trust's strategy is asia, boasting rapid economic growth and huge pools of japanese capital, said cornelissen, whose company administers assets of 71.85 billion dlrs, more than any other canadian trust.     citing statistics indicating that by the year 2000, asia will contain two-thirds of the world's population and 50 pct of global productive capacity, cornelissen said, ""we knew we had to be there."" royal trust's 14 international locations include offices in tokyo, hong kong and singapore. the company also recently listed its shares on the tokyo stock exchange.     the royal trust president said the company was stressing growth within its overseas units, adding he did not foresee any acquisitions in the ""immediate future,"" although ""we have our eyes wide open for the right opportunities.""     asked about royal trust's plans for the u.s., which the company abandoned with the 1983 sale of its florida bank units, cornelissen said the company faced a trust services market well covered by hundreds of small regional banks.     ""that doesn't mean to say we shouldn't be in the u.s.,"" said cornelissen. ""that is probably one area that we will probably do something with in the next five years.""     he said the company would continue to emphasize its home canadian market, which cornelissen and financial services analysts agreed would remain vital to royal trust.     proposed government regulations to allow canadian banks, trusts, insurance and securities dealers full participation in one another's actitivies will mean more domestic competition for royal trust, ""but not drastically more,"" cornelissen said.  reuter ;","('earn',)","('acq',)"

570,"further declines in u.s. debt futures possible after an already steep fall in the past week, u.s. interest rate futures may be in for further declines in the near term, financial analysts said.     however, some analysts said recent sharp losses in bond futures have left the bond market somewhat oversold, and the contracts on long-term debt could stage a recovery before resuming their decline.     key to the near-term direction of futures will be the course of the dollar, they said.     ""as the dollar goes, so goes the bond market,"" said dean witter analyst karen gibbs.     the recent decline in the dollar, which hit a 40-year low against the japanese yen monday, was reversed wednesday when several large u.s. money center banks unexpectedly raised their prime lending rates by a quarter point, to 7-3/4 pct.     ""even though the prime rate cut was good for the dollar, foreign exchange traders are not convinced the dollar decline is over,"" gibbs said.     the dollar decline was key in recent weakness in debt futures as it rekindled concern about a pickup in inflation.     indeed, the falling dollar may have been a key topic at the meeting of the federal reserve's policy making arm, the federal open market committee, this week, analysts said.     ""to the fed, the combination of a falling dollar, a steepening yield curve, and rising commodity prices look suspiciously like the traces of expectations of accelerating inflation,"" said denis karnosky, analyst at carroll, mcentee and mcginley inc.     such expectations could mean that ""a shift in policy toward restriction of bank reserves is likely to get very serious consideration,"" at the fomc meeting, he said.     any such restriction of reserves will not be a highly visible form of monetary tightening, karnosky said.     rather, the key to detecting a change will be found in seasonal and adjustment borrowing at the discount window, he said. borrowings have held near a weekly average of 300 mln dlrs over the past several months, he said.     in the meantime, however, ""the market looks a bit oversold,"" said jim wysoglad, analyst at golden gate futures.     wysoglad said a recovery from the oversold condition could drive june bonds to a high near 99 before falling back to test chart support near the recent low of 97-13/32.     technician leslie keefe of technical data corp of boston said that the key test for june bonds will be whether the nearby contract holds above chart support at 96-24/32.     ""all previous selloffs since mid-november have stopped and buyers have surfaced at that level,"" keefe said.     if that level is broken, and the dollar continues to decline, keefe said she expects the june bond contract to decline to test support between 92 and 93, the primary uptrend line dating back to 1984.  reuter ;","('dlr', 'interest')","('interest',)"

573,"ec commission defends farm program the european community's (ec) executive commission defended attacks on major elements of its ambitious program to rid the ec of its controversial farm surpluses, after strong attacks from northern states.     britain and west germany, backed by the netherlands and denmark, opposed a proposed tax on edible oils and fats which has already sparked strong protest from exporters to the ec led by the u.s. and from ec consumer groups, diplomats said.     but ec agriculture commissioner frans andriessen told journalists he had warned ministers that failure to agree the tax, proposed last month as part of the commission's annual farm price package, would leave a large hole in the group's budget.     he added that he hoped states had not yet made their mind up for good. ""i hope the debate is still open, if not there will be a formidable hole in the budget,"" he said.     the shortfall could reach two billion dollars in 1988 and would be only slightly less this year, he said.     foreign ministers were taking a first look at the tax ahead of farm ministers in a move described by diplomats as unprecedented and welcomed by andriessen as a sign ministers recognised the importance of reforming the ec's farm policy.     the proposed tax is designed to provide the ec with extra cash to finance community oilseed crops at their current levels and to brake a dramatic decrease in olive oil consumption by making it more competitive with other oils.     andriessen noted the ec has over two mln olive oil producers, mostly small farmers, who could be helped by the tax.     ""what we are suggesting is reasonable, it should be better understood not just outside the community but at home,"" he said.     britain, normally a keen advocate of radical changes in the ec's costly farm subsidies system, warned the proposal to impose the tax on both domestic and imported oils and fats could seriously damage the ec's trade relations with other countries.     britain also warned that the tax could hit developing countries already receiving aid from the ec, they said.     the commission also defended proposals to dismantle monetary compensatory amounts (mca) -- a system of cross border subsidies and taxes to level out foreign exchange fluctuations for farm exports -- against harsh west german criticism.     in a letter this weekend from chancellor helmut kohl to ec executive commission president, jacques delors, kohl made clear such a dismantling would mainly hit west german farmers.     diplomats said west germany again repeated its criticism at the talks here but andriessen told journalists that germany had been alone in its opposition. the question was a key aspect of the commission's farm price proposals, he added.    ministers also agreed a 3.5 billion dlrs scheme to rid the ec of its butter mountain, despite spanish and portuguese opposition.     the scheme will pay for the disposal of one mln tonnes of unwanted butter, by selling it at knock-down prices, turning it into animal feed or exporting it at subsidised prices.     national capitals are due to be reimbursed later out of savings from another plan to curb milk production.     diplomats said spain and portugal have been angered by the scheme, which they feel forces them to pay for massive surpluses built up before they joined the community last year, but the two countries did not block today's vote.  reuter ;","('oilseed', 'veg-oil')","('veg-oil',)"

592,"poehl looks set for eight more years at bundesbank for currency dealers karl otto poehl is the scourge of speculators, for bankers he is the man who has played a key role in shaping the world's financial destiny for the last seven years, and for germans he is the guardian of the mark.     president of the powerful and independent west german central bank, the bundesbank, poehl is likely to have his contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the end of this year, government officials say.     (index of economic spotlights, see page ecra)     but no official announcement has yet been made, raising eyebrows in west germany's business community.     the ebullient poehl spent seven years in bonn in top ministerial posts under the social democrats, now in opposition, before he moved to the bundesbank.     there has been speculation that chancellor helmut kohl would try to replace poehl with a man closer to his own christian democrats. but officials noted that poehl has worked closely and successfully with finance minister gerhard stoltenberg since kohl's government took office in 1982.     poehl, the most senior central banker apart from paul volcker of the united states, enjoys a strong international reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up.     given these circumstances, kohl will probably overlook poehl's past as an adviser to former social democrat chancellor willy brandt, and top aide to helmut schmidt when he was finance minister, bankers said. it was schmidt who, as chancellor, appointed poehl to his present job in 1980.     in recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the dollar, poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of the bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institution which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent inflation catching hold. older germans can remember two bouts of galloping inflation this century.     but with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and inflation negligible so far this year, poehl thinks it is safe to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the dangers to the german economy of a bloated exchange rate.     ""i am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the dollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the bundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark would endanger the economy in west germany,"" he told business journalists in frankfurt recently.     ute geipel, head of research at citibank ag, says that poehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.     ""poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not focus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external economy,"" she said.     an economist at a german bank, who declined to be identified, said ""if poehl is confirmed in his post, it will certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so rigidly oriented towards money supply.""     one of poehl's great struggles recently has been to persuade the united states to stop ""talking down"" the dollar. for poehl, the significance of the february louvre accord was that the united states agreed to join efforts to stabilise currencies.     the louvre accord was greeted with scepticism by currency dealers who said they would soon put it to the test. but in fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.     ""this is because the markets know - or perhaps because they don't know - what the central banks can do,"" poehl says of intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates round, making a speculator's position worthless.     poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist in the 1960s before starting his ministerial career.     a relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over a glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker.     he is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and play golf.     poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.     ""but you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount if you strike at the right moment,"" he said. bundesbank dealers are very professional and skilled. ""they've burnt the fingers of many people,"" he said. and unlike the speculators, poehl notes, the bundesbank dealers usually make a profit.  reuter ;","('money-fx',)","('money-fx',)"

609,"eyskens says us prime rises will aid currencies belgian finance minister mark eyskens warmly welcomed this week's increase in u.s. prime rates, calling it a move that went beyond the group of five and canada paris accord on stabilising currencies.     the rate rise would underpin economic and financial policy convergence among major countries, he added.     in an interview with reuters, eyskens also made clear he believed the countries involved in the accord - the u.s., japan, west germany, france, britain and canada - had agreed ""tentative"" fluctuation ranges for exchange rates.     eyskens was speaking before hosting an informal meeting of european community finance ministers and central bank chiefs in belgium this weekend focusing on the international monetary situation and proposals for strengthening the european monetary system (ems).     asked about the dollar's recent fall on currency markets, eyskens said he believed the paris agreement was proving ""more or less workable"" despite what he called evident disagreements over u.s. economic and monetary policy between treasury secretary james baker and federal reserve chairman paul volcker.     besides baker's public statements that had dramatically influenced exchange markets, trade tensions between the u.s.and japan had also caused the dollar's fall, expecially against the yen, he said.     but he expressed optimism that washington and tokyo could reach a compromise in their row over semi-conductor trade. ""i think agreement is quite possible,"" he said.      eyskens said he was ""very agreeably surprised"" by this week's quarter-point increase in u.s. prime rates despite the obvious negative consequences for debtor countries.     ""it is a positive element which goes further than the (paris) louvre agreement ...it is the market taking account of its content,"" he said.     he added that coordination of interest rates was a fundamental element of economic and monetary convergence between leading industrialised economies.     ""a policy of maintaining exchange rates within fluctuation ranges is not possible if it is not accompanied at least by a more coordinated policy of interest rates,"" he said.     eyskens made clear he believed the g-6 countries had agreed in paris on ranges in which to hold their currencies.     he said the end of the february 22 louvre accord, in which the partners agreed to cooperate closely to foster exchange rate stability around current levels, clearly alluded to a ""system of tentative (fluctuation) margins.""     he added the meeting and the statement would have been meaningless if the g-6 had not discussed the technicalities of implementing it.     eyskens said there was growing economic convergence among leading industrialised countries pointing towards greater order in the international monetary system.     ""that doesn't mean we are ready to restore bretton woods (the post-world war two system of fixed exchange rates), but within the (international monetary fund) interim committee we are thinking in terms of target zones, fluctuation ranges to be implemented and defended,"" he said.     the interim committee meets next week in washington ahead of the imf's spring meetings, and eyskens said the ec ministers would prepare for the gatherings at this weekend's talks.     he said he hoped for wide-ranging talks on the future of the ems at the weekend meeting, based on proposals from the ec's monetary committee and committee of central bank governors for strengthening the system through technical and institutional changes.     eyskens said he expected ec commission president jacques delors to submit proposals for fully liberalising capital movements within the 12-nation bloc and made clear he shared delors' view that this must be accompanied by a reinforcement of the ems. ""both are totally linked. liberalisation without strengthening the ems would destabilise the community,"" he said.  reuter ;","('interest', 'money-fx')","('money-fx',)"

676,"u.s. sugar policy may self-destruct, congressman a leading u.s. farm-state congressman, jerry huckaby, d-la., warned he will press next year for legislation to control domestic production of sweeteners, perhaps including corn sweeteners, if the industry fails to voluntarily halt output increases this year.     ""we're moving toward a direction where we could self-destruct (the u.s. sugar program),"" rep. huckaby, chairman of the house agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar issues, told reuters in an interview.     huckaby, who told u.s. sugarbeet growers earlier this year they must halt production increases, said he will deliver the same message to louisiana sugarcane growers friday. he also said he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject.     huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic sweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further cuts in the sugar import quota, now at one mln short tons.     ""i think if we're talking about dropping (the quota) another half mln tons, lets say, you're getting to the point where the program might not work,"" he said.     ""ideally, i'd like to freeze things right where we are,"" said huckaby, leading advocate for sugar growers in congress.     a freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the current level of 6.5 mln tons, the corn sweetener share of the u.s. market staying at just over 50 pct, and u.s sugar imports holding at about 1.2 mln tons, huckaby said.     a decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made until 1987 output numbers are known late this year, he said.     ""i feel like if we didn't expand production, we could probably hold where we are indefinitely, or at least through the 1985 farm bill without any changes (in the sugar program),"" huckaby said.     however, much depends on whether high-fructose corn syrup producers continue to expand their share of the u.s. sweetener market from just over 50 pct, huckaby said.     he noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will capture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in the u.s.     but he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the production of a new crystalline corn sweetener which further expanded the corn sweetener share, then u.s. sugar imports might be eliminated and u.s. sugar output severely reduced.     huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner companies such as a.e. staley and archer daniels midland soon.     ""this program is advantageous to the corn users. they have some natural, legitimate self-interest in seeing that the program is preserved,"" huckaby said.     huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to think about how domestic output could be controlled, either through production allocations, acreage or marketing controls.     huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the justice department to determine if it would be legal to ask corn refiners to limit production.     ""i don't know if we will go this route, but if we do there's a question in my mind at this point in time; can you do that legally?"" he said.     asked if he would proceed with production controls without the support of corn refiners, huckaby said ""you build a fragile house if you do it that way.""     huckaby said he understands why u.s. cane and beet farmers have expanded production, because high sugar price support means returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such as soybeans and grain.     but he said for sugar growers as a whole, expansion would not be good policy.     huckaby said he has tried to stress, in his speeches to sugar industry groups, that if growers continue to expand, they may be penalized retroactively under any production control legislation passed next year.     huckaby said congress is unlikely to approve any changes in the sugar program this year despite a reagan administration proposal to drastically slash the program.     ""the administration proposal is so drastic, that i don't think it will get up a head of steam,"" huckaby said.     he said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price support is unlikely to be approved.     instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program, huckaby said the reagan administration should file a complaint with the general agreement on tariffs and trade against the european community's sugar policy. he said ec policies are the major cause of the depressed world sugar market.  reuter ;","('corn', 'grain', 'sugar')","('sugar',)"

""however, so long as u.s. product inventories remain high, it may be difficult to fully recover from the depressed margins of recent periods,"" he added.     bookout said the company's chemical products earnings should benefit from strong performances in chemical sales volumes and continued high industry operating rates.     shell said its oil and gas exploration and product segment earned 110 mln dlrs for the quarter vs 91 mln dlrs in 1986.     it said earnings were hurt by lower selling prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. domestic crude oil prices averaged 14.24 dlrs a barrel, compared with 19.28 dlrs last year, while natural gas prices dropped 24 pct, shell said.     shell said earnings at its oil products segment plunged by 53 mln dlrs, to eight mln dlrs. it said lower refined product selling prices were only partially offset by reduced raw material costs.     the company said earnings from chemical products also fell sharply, to 40 mln dlrs from 72 mln dlrs, due mainly to lower margins, especially in commodity chemicals, coupled with its pullout from the agricultural chemicals business in october 1986.     shell said capital and exploratory outlays totaled 500 mln dlrs for the quarter, off from 645 mln dlrs.  reuter ;","('crude', 'gas', 'nat-gas', 'pet-chem')","('earn',)"

""the most urgent problem now is the trade question because that has to be decided within the next 10 months,"" clark told the commonwealth club of california.

""this rash of countervailing actions, where we acted on corn and you acted on soft wood and we both said they were quasijudicial -- the dispute resolution mechanisims in place now are not working adequately in either of our interests,"" he said.     ottawa also is seeking to change some of washington's rules on government procurement that penalize canadian businesses, he said.     ""there are a number of canadian companies that, in order to secure substantial contracts in the united states, have had to move their head offices out of our country into your country because you have national procurement requirements,"" he said.     in turn, he added, the united states would like to change some of the procurement requirements that exist at the provincial government level in canada.     clark declined to forecast the outcome of the discussions.

""it appears that the chernobyl disaster had a worse effect on its (the soviet) grain harvest than reported,"" one said.     freight rates on the gulf/japan grain route have subsequently been the main beneficiary of current chartering conditions, with very few, if any, panamax sized ships left for the remainder of this month in the gulf. rates have risen steadily for vessels loading next month.     dealers said there is even talk that owners are considering taking older vessels out of lay-up to meet current demand.     sentiment has also been aided by suggestions that chinese operators may be in the market for similar timecharter business later in the year, they said.     they anticipate this would appear around june and it has prompted keen demand in the july biffex contract, despite it normally being a slack time in the shipping year.     market sentiment has fluctuated in recent weeks. rates turned down as an earlier rise in bunker prices, which had supported the market at the start of the year, faltered but then recovered on the reported soviet interest.  reuter ;","('grain', 'ship')","('ship',)"

""it looks like a reasonably harmonious visit in prospect, more harmonious than usual.""     since taking office a year ago, chirac has been obliged to deal with a series of potentially serious disputes with the united states.     during the u.s. bombing of alleged terrorist targets in libya last april, france refused to allow british-based u.s. planes to overfly its territory, forcing them to take a circuitous route. that angered washington.     the u.s. officials, who asked not to be identified, said a year ago washington felt the french were not taking strong enough action against terrorism.

""the very probability of a growth in demand set against the massive investment required for expansion - and that expansion only being viable in south africa or russia - leads me to conclude that the price of platinum will be substantially underpinned in the medium to long-term,"" clark said.  reuter ;","('platinum',)","('gold',)"

864,"u.k. potato futures trading not to be suspended trading on the london potato futures market will not be suspended, richard harris, chairman of the london potato futures association (lpfa), said in a statement to floor members.     it was in response to strong representations by the potato marketing board (pmb) complaining of a gross distortion of price which they say will result in large deliveries into the physical market when the april futures position expires.     the pmb had sought an immediate suspension in futures trading and asked the lpfa to take action to restore the relationship between futures and physicals.     farmers and merchants have alleged a squeeze and cornering of the market but harris pointed out that recent investigations by the association of futures brokers and dealers (afbd), the international commodities clearing house (icch) and other parties, found no evidence to substantiate this.     the main complaint from some sections of the physical market is what they say is an unrealistic futures premium over the pmb's average ex-farm price. april futures traded this morning between 168 and 170 stg per tonne compared with pmb's average price of 104 stg.     bill englebright, joint secretary of the lpfa said there is a two-tier market for physical potatoes. he said quality potatoes are in short supply and prepackers have been paying between 145 and 165 stg per tonne for best samples. but lesser quality grades have traded below 100 stg.     some merchants fear that a large tonnage will be delivered against the april futures contract between now and the end of the month, and possibly disrupt the physical market.     harris said the lpfa rule book allows the management committee to take steps as necessary to correct any malpractice and he assured the committee is monitoring the situation.  reuter ;","('potato',)","('money-fx',)"
865,"u.k. base rates will fall again soon, say analysts today's modest half-point cut in u.k. bank base lending rates to 10 pct signals the bank of england's determination to maintain a cautious monetary stance, but financial markets appear set to force its hand, analysts said.     they said a further half-point cut in base rates to 9-1/2 pct was bound to occur within the next week and rates may shed a further half point soon if markets remain buoyant.     earlier, markets were bracing for a one-point cut in rates after yesterday's budget set a sharp three billion stg reduction in 1987 government borrowing targets to four billion stg.     sterling money market rates moved lower again, with the key three-month interbank rate down to 9-5/8 1/2 pct at the start of business from 9-11/16 9/16 yesterday, and sterling rallied to four-year highs against the dollar in very active trading.     government bond prices also surged on the budget, with gains in excess of one point pushing yields on long-term paper below nine pct for the first time in nearly a year.     but today's smaller than expected rate cut appeared to have placated markets for now, analysts said. money market rates recovered up to 1/4 point from earlier lows while both sterling and gilts came off highs as trading ground to a near halt.     analysts said the slowdown was likely to be temporary, and the reappraisal of sterling assets by international investors was set to resume as early as tomorrow, leading to higher gilt prices, exchange rate advances and lower money market rates.     ""today's cut was slightly disappointing,"" said bill martin, chief u.k. economist at stockbrokers phillips and drew. ""the bank of england is taking a very cautious line ... to temper the markets' first rush of blood to the head after the budget.""     analysts said the bank's move today to lend two-week cash to u.k. discount houses at a lower 10 pct suggested it hoped to maintain the new rates for about that period of time.     the analysts agreed success would depend largely on how sterling performs in the near term.     sharp rises in the pound's value could be checked initially through bank of england intervention but eventually the gains would force the bank to cut interest rates rates again.     ""the market seems to have accepted the modest cut for the time being,"" said midland bank treasury economist david simmonds. ""but i am sceptical that the bank will be able to hold up rates for long.""     simmonds said he saw sterling rising another two u.s. cents this week from around 1.60 dlrs, forcing a rate cut by friday.     robin marshall, chief economist at chase manhattan securities, said ""there is another half point to come in the near term, this week or next week at the latest...we see a whole point off base rates in the next two or three weeks.""     analysts stressed that apart from prestige, britain had very little to gain from a sharp rise in sterling's exchange rate.     martin, of phillips and drew, said the dampening effect of a sterling rise on consumer price inflation would not materialise for at least nine months while its hampering impact on manufactured exports would show almost immediately.     analysts said the budget, featuring income tax cuts as well as cautious plans for public finances, had improved the chances of re-election for the conservative government and probably advanced the election date. one must be held before june, 1988. combined with overall good prospects for the u.k. economy, this was likely to fuel a foreign rush on sterling-denominated assets, pushing the pound's value well above unofficial targets.     with mark-denominated investments largely out of favour because of low yields and a dull economic outlook, chase's marshall said ""sterling is simply the best game in town, especially after the budget, and demand will remain strong.""  reuter ;","('interest', 'money-fx')","('interest',)"

""if the refining sector can discipline itself to refine about 12 mln barrels of crude oil a day, we have a chance to pull down inventories to acceptable levels by the second quarter, said archie dunham, executive vice president of petroluem products at conoco inc     ""if not, the industry will have a tough 1987,"" he added.      last week's american petroleum institute report said that u.s. refining capacity rose three pct to 78.7 pct of capacity, with crude oil runs at 12.2 mln barrels per day for the week ended march 20.      the api said that with the higher crude oil runs,  distillate and gasoline inventories were sharply above year-ago levels. gasoline stocks were at 245.6 mln barrels, some 17.2 mln barrels above year-ago levels. distillate stocks, at 108.7 mln barrels, are 10.9 mln barrels above last year's level, the api said.      henry rosenberg, chairman of crown central petroleum corp <cnp> told reuters that unless refining and marketing return to profitability, oil companies will have to rely on downstream operations to produce an acceptable level of earnings.      ""the jump in refining capacity is a concern if it continues,"" said kenneth buckler, executive vice president of refining and marketing at <total petroleum co>, a u.s. subsidiary of cie francaise des petroles of france.      refineries should operate near 75 pct of capacity given the current level of demand but the operating level should increase as gasoline demand picks up in the next quarter, buckler said.      dunham said the potential operable capacity of u.s. refineries should also be cut about 500,000 barrels of crude per day. ""i expect to see the shutdown of more small refineries over the next five years,"" he said, adding that these facilities refine between 10,000 and 30,000 barrels of crude oil per day. the api said u.s. operations have the capacity to refine 15.6 mln bpd of crude.  reuter ;","('crude',)","('crude',)"

895,"france announces plan to boost employment the government announced a three billion franc program to combat long-term unemployment amid speculation among political and economic analysts that it is positioning itself for a period of economic reflation.     the package presented to the cabinet of prime minister jacques chirac by social affairs and labour minister philippe seguin today is to be financed out of a 7.5 billion franc contingency fund announced on february 25.     finance minister edouard balladur previously ruled out a reflationary program.     long-term unemployment, defined as being out of work for more than one year, affects about 830,000 people or one third of french unemployed, government figures show.     the main measures of the employment program give employers financial incentives to offer short-term work contracts of at least two years and stress retraining to help the long-term unemployed return to the labour market.     training subsidies and exemptions from social security contributions are the main incentives for employers.     ""companies tell us that we have to give them a strong incentive to take on people who have fallen out of the labour market and that's why the proposals...are costly,"" an aide to seguin said.     the analysts said speculation the government is considering a reflationary program was sparked by chirac spokesman denis baudouin, who said yesterday that ministers were generally agreed on the desirability of relaunching the economy.     he appeared to contradict statements by balladur ruling out economic stimulation despite the government's revision of its 1987 growth forecast to about 2.0 pct from 2.8.     finance ministry officials later clarified baudouin's remarks, saying there was no question of any move to stimulate the economy through a boost to consumer spending although government policy allowed for increased industrial investment from the proceeds of france's five-year privatisation plan.     the 1987 budget allowed for 30 billion francs in revenue from privatisation, to be split between repaying national debt and providing state enterprises with fresh capital.     some political analysts said baudouin's comments possibly reflect widening differences within the rpr-udf coalition on social issues ahead of next year's presidential elections.      divisions began to show last december, when a wave of strikes led by transport workers paralysed the country and drove the government into a new mood of conciliation with labour.      officials said that after the success of the privatisation of cie de saint gobain <sgep.pa> and cie financiere de paribas <pari.pa> the government had decided to speed up its five-year privatisation program with the aim of completing a third of it this year, ahead of the presidential elections expected in 1988.     the accelerated program could provide additional unbudgeted revenue to boost industrial and research investment and spending on infrastructure such as the national motorway network.    the government also today revived a proposal, blocked last year by socialist president francois mitterrand, to encourage more flexible working hours, which it says will boost jobs by improving the competitiveness of french industry.     the proposals allowing night-shift work by women and variations in the standard 39-hour working week are to be put to parliament as a self-contained draft bill after being vetoed for procedural reasons by mitterrand and later the council of state.  reuter ;","('jobs',)","('trade',)"

""changes in these standards must be agreed upon multilaterally. they cannot be imposed by the united states alone on the world trading system,"" he said.     house leaders have rejected a plan by textile-state legislators to add to the trade bill a provision to curb imports of cloth and clothing, similar to a measure passed two years ago but vetoed by president reagan.     there was concern by the leaders that reagan would veto the entire trade bill because of the textile amendment.      reuter ;","('trade',)","('trade',)"

913,"illinois co-op futures dissolution vote set the shareholders of illinois cooperative futures co., the futures trading arm of many midwest farm cooperatives for more than 25 years, will vote wednesday on its possible dissolution.     the directors of the company called a special meeting and recommended its dissolution last month, citing falling volume and increasing costs.     sources close to the organization told reuters the pullout of growmark, inc., which holds more than 70 pct of the capital stock, led to the call for dissolution.     the possible demise of the cooperative has set clearing houses scrambling for the trading business of the 85 regional and local cooperatives that comprise its membership.     ironically, it was growmark, at that time a regional farm cooperative with major river terminal elevators, that founded illinois cooperative futures on december 1, 1960.     but growmark became affiliated last year with archer daniels midland of decatur, ill., and markets its grain through a joint subsidiary of the two companies, adm/growmark.     with that relationship, growmark no longer needs to trade futures through the cooperative, said tom mulligan, president of the co-op.     membership in the company, which mulligan termed a cooperative of cooperatives, has declined from 99 in 1982. a notable loss was agriindustries of iowa, which became affiliated with cargill, inc.     illinois co-op's other members include such regional cooperatives as indiana grain, based in indianapolis, goldkist, of atlanta, ga., midstates in toledo, ohio, farmland industries in kansas city, mo., farmers commodities, des moines, and harvest states in minneapolis.     some observors said the demise of illinois cooperative futures co. is a serious blow to the cooperative system.     instead of banding together, the individual cooperatives are forced to go their own ways, said the floor manager of one cash house at the chicago board of trade.     such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farm cooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a few major commercial companies are growing dominant, he said.     don hanes, vice president for communications with the national council of farm cooperatives, said 5,600 cooperatives exist today, down from 6,700 five years ago.     ""the period we've gone through in the past five years has been quite a crunch,"" he said. ""there's been a lot of consolidation in the marketing co-ops.""     one problem, he said, is the co-ops sell the grain to the major commercials for export, rather than exporting it themselves, losing potential profits.     but exporting grain requires heavy investments, and the multi-million-dollar loss posted six years ago by farmers export co., a co-op set up to export grains, served ""to make folks gun-shy,"" hanes said.     mulligan said he believes the dissolution, if it is approved, is a result of change in the futures industry rather than a change in u.s. agricultural economics.     a grain dealer at one member co-op said the futures arm ""was a convenience, something that saved us a little bit of money. (its dissolution) will force us to change our way of doing business.""     ""we're sorry to see the co-op go by the wayside,"" he said. ""but there are lot of people out there to do business with. there are plenty of capable firms.""     steven w. cavanaugh, vice president for grain marketing with indiana grain, said he would prefer to trade futures through a chicago-based cooperative.     ""in terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed to individuals, there would be economic savings,"" he said but added, ""the times change and with changing times, come different opinions of what businesses ought to be around.""     cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm had nothing to do with its profitability. ""i would guarantee you that this company is not in trouble. it is a sound, healthy organization.""     in the year ended february 28, 1986, the illinois cooperative reported income of 10.2 mln dlrs and members' equity, or net worth, of 8.3 mln dlrs. the annual report for the most recent year has not been filed.     under the cooperative system, income from operations is returned as ""patronage refunds"" to the members.     income and refunds in the past five years have been declining. in the year ended february 28, 1982, the co-op reported income of 17.4 mln dlrs and patronage refunds of 17.0 mln dlrs. patronage refunds in the year ended february 28, 1986, totalled 9.5 mln dlrs.     ""you're dealing with substantially lower volume,"" mulligan said. ""lower volume translates into higher costs.""     according to the company's 1986 annual report, growmark owns 90 pct of the preferred shares and four pct of the common shares of illinois cooperative futures co.     mulligan declined to speculate on how much of the capital growmark is entitled to. he said he could not determine the figure unless the shareholders decide in favor of dissolution. equity is distributed according to each member's trading volume and, as a result, changes from year to year.     however, mulligan said the company could continue to meet minimum capital requirements to trade futures even if growmark pulled out.  reuter ;","('grain',)","('acq',)"

916,"new leader coming to u.s. sec in challenging era president reagan's nominee as top policeman for the nation's securities markets will inherit an agency challenged by an insider trading scandal, wild stock price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the globalization of financial markets.     david ruder, a 58-year-old republican law professor at northwestern university in evanston, ill., was named thursday to be the 23rd chairman of the five-member u.s. securities and exchange commission.     if confirmed by the senate, as expected, he will succeed john shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a record six years as chairman to become ambassador to the netherlands.     the sec has been in the limelight for the past year as its investigators have probed into the most colossal insider trading scandal ever uncovered on wall street.     the investigation, which is still active, mushroomed in recent months as a growing number of well known traders and prominent investment banking firms have been charged with wrongdoing.     the pace of the probe picked up markedly in november after ivan boesky, one of wall street's most successful stock speculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigators and to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal profits after being charged with insider trading.     but the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred by computer-driven trading strategies that span markets in  securities, options and futures. the price gyrations have combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented volatility to some u.s. securities markets.     at the same time, the sec is being pressed by some lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers steadily reshapes the u.s. corporate landscape.     and the agency is being pushed by u.s. and foreign exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork for an international securities marketplace in which trading occurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.     such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment opportunities but could strain the sec's ability to enforce u.s. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.     under the leadership of shad, the sec eased financial disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies, eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's review of hostile corporate takeovers.     shad, who had been vice chairman of the e. f. hutton investment banking firm, brought a wall street perspective to the agency upon being named chairman in 1981.     in line with the views of other top administration officials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover battles over new federal regulations.     the sec under shad also stressed prosecution of insider trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that topped the agency's enforcement agenda during the administration of president jimmy carter, a democrat.     securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to significantly alter the commission's current priorities.     the sec currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them lawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.     the agency is one of the few in the government that actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past few years because of fees it charges public companies, investment banks and other securities firms it regulates.     the sec is structured as an independent regulatory agency, meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing for policy differences alone.     by law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same political party, and the agency prepares its own budget request each year instead of leaving this to the white house.     established by congress in 1934, the sec traces its origins to the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted market manipulations by large investment firms.     the agency requires public companies and investment vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on their financial condition and to disclose changes in their condition any time they issue new securities.     it requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to register with it and comply with investor protection rules, and it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.     its first chairman was joseph kennedy, an industrial magnate who was also the father of john kennedy, later to become the nation's 35th president.     other former chairmen include william douglas, who served from 1937 until his appointment to the u.s. supreme court in 1939, and william casey, who served during president nixon's first

948,"call money pressure from large german banks one or two large west german banks effectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity at the end of the month in order to achieve higher rates from their overnight deposits, money dealers said.     as a result, call money soared in active trading to around the lombard rate of five pct from 3.70/80 pct yesterday as banks found themselves short of minimum reserve funds.     bundesbank figures showed that banks held an average daily 51 billion marks in interest-free minimum reserve assets at the central bank over the first 29 days of the month.     though this was above the march requirement of 50.7 billion, actual holdings at the weekend were 44.2 billion.     to meet the daily average, dealers said, banks must raise holdings by two billion marks to 46.3 billion today and tomorrow. but liquidity was tight in early business because banks excessively took up the bundesbank's offer for sale of treasury bills on friday. this provides a rate of 3.50 pct for three-day deposits and is an effective floor to the market.     though some liquidity, from bills bought on thursday, flowed back into the market today, the bulk would not return until tomorrow, the start of the new month, dealers said.     dealers said the large banks, which they did not name, commanded short-term money requirements of as much as five billion marks or so.     with a knowledge of their own needs until the end of the month, the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills, draining liquidity for three days. when other banks sought funds, rates rose and large banks were able to place excess funds on deposit at a considerably higher average return.     one senior dealer said the bundesbank, with advanced knowledge of the market's needs, should have curtailed its sales of treasury bills on friday.     though dealers only late in the day learn of the total minimum reserve holdings of the previous day, the bundesbank has an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipate the strength of demand for funds the following day, he said.     ""(bundesbank dealers) could easily have said we are not selling any treasury bills or we're not selling them in this amount,"" he said. ""if the bundesbank wants to finely steer the market then they should avoid such excesses. tomorrow it will be different. call money will fall back to 4.0 pct or so.""     but the bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump in rates, given the delicate state of currency markets.     international central banks have been at pains to prevent a dollar fall against major currencies, including the mark. dealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmer undertone, contributing to downward pressure on the dollar.     ""the whole tender policy is to have a call money of between three and four pct. in that case the excesses as we have today cannot be very popular,"" the senior dealer said.     dealers said the large banks probably achieved average rates of return on their excess funds of between 3.75 pct or four pct. this is a higher return than they would have earned without the excessive draining through the treasury bill mechanism.     because of the currency situation and the wage negotiations between germany's major employers and the unions, the bundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes to monetary policy at its council meeting on thursday, they said.     bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on the lombard emergency funding facility to draw down 1.5 billion marks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business.  reuter ;","('money-fx',)","('interest',)"

""there is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment,"" said takashi kiuchi, senior economist for the long-term credit bank of japan ltd.     the government, which published the january unemployment figures today, did not make any predictions.     ""at present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving,"" a labour ministry official said.     finance minister kiichi miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in april.     prime minister yasuhiro nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms.     the yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries. other export-dependent industries, such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring, economists said.     although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down, said koichi tsukihara, deputy general manager of sumitomo bank ltd's economics department.     however, other economists disagreed, saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years.     the economists said the service sector should grow as the government stimulates domestic demand under its program to transform the economy away from exports.     although japanese unemployment rates appear lower than those of other industrialised nations, methods for calculating statistics make them difficult to compare, economists warned.     ""the three pct figure  could translate into a relatively high figure if european methods were used,"" one economist said. more than half of january's 170,000 increase in jobless from a year earlier were those aged between 15 and 24, sumitomo's tsukihara said.  reuter ;","('jobs',)","('jobs',)"

""the world's cocoa price at present is just not interesting,"" commented one delegate representing a major cpa producer.     another source said that with much of the 1986/87 (october-september) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in the near term concerns essentially next year's harvest.     the sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in brazil, the world's number two producer, is in private hands. this means limiting sales is more difficult than in major west african producers, where sales are made or authorized by commodity marketing boards.     the cpa includes the world's top three producers, ivory coast, brazil and ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output.     the meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening.  reuter ;","('cocoa',)","('cocoa',)"

""it is important to enhance the likelihood of home-country discoveries with measures such as non-discriminatory and stable taxation, and minimum regulation, together with opening up of acreage for exploration,"" he said.     increasing reliance on the middle east will also boost the incentive to use natural gas and synthetic sources of petroleum, he added.  reuter ;","('crude',)","('crude',)"

""the u.s. has decided to go through proper channels.""     u.s. trade officials again made clear their anger over what they call unfair government support for airbus, voiced during a visit to european capitals in february.     in a letter calling for the special committee meeting, washington charged france, west germany, the u.k., spain and the ec commission with unfair practices on behalf of airbus.     the u.s. charges that the europeans are violating rules laid down in the 1979 agreement on trade in civil aircraft.     washington presented its reading of rules on inducement to purchase aircraft and support for development of airlines during the special session and asked the committee to confirm its view.     official sources in the delegations said the u.s. views would be considered during the informal consultations but the europeans would also be free to bring up any complaints against american civil aircraft practices.     some delegates said the u.s. position appeared to give such broad interpretation to the rules as to suggest that the civil aircraft accord needed re-negotiating. all these matters would be considered during the informal meetings.  reuter ;","('trade',)","('trade',)"

1029,"cocoa origins dismayed by buffer stock action traders recently returned from west africa say some producers there are dismayed by the ineffective action so far by the international cocoa organization (icco) buffer stock manager on buffer stock purchases.     one trader said some west african producers are annoyed the buffer stock manager is not playing his part as required by the international cocoa pact to stabilise prices from current lows.     so far, only 21,000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have been taken up for buffer stock purposes and this, traders noted, only on an intermittent basis.     they noted the purchases, of 8,000 tonnes in the first week he bought and 13,000 in the second, are well short of the limitations of no more than 5,000 tonnes in one day and 20,000 in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him.     the traders recently returned from west africa say producers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices so far, noting producing countries are part of the international cocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers.     london traders say terminal market prices would have to gain around 300 stg a tonne to take the icco 10-day average indicator to its 1,935 sdr per tonne midway point (or reference price).     however, little progress has been made in that direction, and the 10-day average is still well below the 1,600 sdr lower intervention level at 1,562.87 from 1,569.46 previously.     the buffer stock manager may announce today he will be making purchases tomorrow, although under the rules of the agreement such action is not automatic, traders said.     complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock manager are not confined to west african producers, they observed.     a reuter report from rotterdam quoted industry sources there saying dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with the intermittent buffer stock buying activities.     in london, traders expressed surprise that no more than 21,000 tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against total potential purchases under the new agreement of 150,000 tonnes. carryover holdings from the previous international cocoa agreement in the stock total 100,000 tonnes.     terminal prices today rose by up to 10 stg a tonne from friday's close, basis july at its high of 1,271.     it seems that when the buffer stock manager is absent from the market, prices go up, while when he declares his intention to buy, quite often the reverse applies, traders said.  reuter ;","('cocoa',)","('cocoa',)"

1035,"analysts doubt fed firmed despite borrowing rise economists said that they doubt the federal reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despite higher discount window borrowings in the latest two-week statement period and very heavy borrowings wednesday.     data out today show net borrowings from the fed averaged 393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to wednesday, up from 265 mln dlrs in the prior statement period. wednesday borrowings were 1.4 billion dlrs as federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.     ""one could make a case that the fed is firming, but it probably isn't,"" said william sullivan of dean witter reynolds.     sullivan said some may assume the fed has firmed policy modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the two-weeks to wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.     however, the dean witter economist noted that the latest two-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand often pushes up borrrowings.     ""some might argue that the fed was firming policy, but it looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions late in the statement period and didn't quite make it,"" said ward mccarthy of merrill lynch capital markets.     a fed spokesman told a press press conference today that the fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or more in its reserve projections in the week ended wednesday.     still, mccarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.     the fed took no market reserve management action last thursday and friday, the first two days of the week. it added temporary reserves indirectly on monday via two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves directly via system repurchases on tuesday and wednesday.     based on fed data out today, economists calculated that the two-day system repurchase agreements the fed arrranged on tuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. they put wednesday's overnight system repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.     ""it is quite clear that the fed is not firming policy at this time,"" said larry leuzzi of s.g. warburg and co inc.     citing the view shared by the other two economists, leuzzi said the fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak economies in the united states and abroad and add to the financial stress of developing countries and their lenders.     ""those who believe the fed tightened policy in the latest statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar tumbled,"" said mccarthy of merrill lynch.     he said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new statement period began today on disappointment yesterday's washington meetings of international monetary officials failed to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.     in fact, currency dealers said there was nothing in wednesday's g-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade imbalance between the united states and japan.     the economists generally agreed that the fed is aiming for steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average fed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. this is about where the rate has been since early november.     ""i'm not so sure that the fed is engineering a tighter policy to help the dollar, as some suspect,"" said sullivan of dean witter.     if it is, however, he said that fed probably has just nudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct from six to 6.10 pct previously.  reuter ;","('dlr', 'interest', 'money-fx')","('money-supply',)"

1040,"japan beef price support cut will not raise demand japan's plan to cut beef intervention prices for the fiscal year starting april 1 will not boost demand because of strict supply controls and a complex distribution system, japanese and u.s. industry sources said.     ""government beef policy protects farmers rather than meeting consumers' demands and the cutback ... is too marginal,"" a housewives association of japan official said.     despite mounting u.s. pressure on japan to open farm markets, beef is strictly controlled by the government, which maintains a price stabilisation zone to protect farmers.     under the plan, expected to be announced this month, the standard or bottom price of castrated wagyu -- known as marbled beef -- will be set at 1,370 yen per kilo for 1987/88 against 1,400 now, and the ceiling at 1,780 yen against 1,820.     the standard price of other beef, mainly produced from dairy steers, is set at 1,020 yen against 1,090 and the ceiling at 1,325 against 1,420.     ministry officials said the semi-government livestock industry promotion corp (lipc) conducts buffer stock operations to help keep wholesale beef prices within the intervention price zone.     the lipc is allowed to import most beef, with the amount set by the government under a quota system. when wholesale prices go above the ceiling, the lipc releases its beef stocks, both domestic and imported, and buys locally produced beef when prices are below.     but the lipc has often been criticised for releasing beef stocks when the prices are higher than the ceiling.     phillip seng, asian director of the u.s. meat export federation, told reuters the two pct cut in prices is a step toward closing the gap with european community prices, about half those in japan.     but seng said the cut will not benefit consumers or u.s. meat exporters because of japan's rigid and complicated distribution system and strict supply control by the lipc.     the housewives association official said retail beef prices are high mainly because of distribution problems and high production costs, as well as poor operations by the lipc.     american meat packers see japan as a promising market. f.c. beatty, of u.s. packer john morrell and co, told the japan times beef cuts, which sell for 1.20 to 3.00 dlrs a pound in the u.s., are sold at 15 to 30 dlrs in japan.     but seng said the cut will not benefit consumers or u.s. meat exporters because of japan's rigid and complicated distribution system and strict supply control by the lipc.     the housewives association official said retail beef prices are high mainly because of distribution problems and high production costs, as well as poor operations by the lipc.     american meat packers see japan as a promising market. f.c. beatty, of u.s. packer john morrell and co, told the japan times beef cuts, which sell for 1.20 to 3.00 dlrs a pound in the u.s., are sold at 15 to 30 dlrs in japan.     but industry sources said it is unclear how much demand will pick up if retail beef prices drop following any sharp reduction in intervention prices.     u.s. agriculture secretary richard lyng said this week he will ask japan to remove all beef import restrictions when he visits here next month.     in 1984, japan decided to increase its beef import quota by 9,000 tonnes a year until march 31, 1988.     in 1987/88, the quota will rise to 177,000 tonnes from 168,000 in 1986/87, ministry officials said, adding japan wants to keep self-sufficiency in beef at around 70 pct.  reuter ;","('carcass', 'livestock')","('carcass', 'livestock')"

""i think it is possible that there may be scope for a further reduction in interest rates in germany,"" he added, but stressed that he had had no indication that such a move was likely. he made no mention of japanese interest rates.     lawson said the u.s. should embark on ""a gradual reduction of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years.""     he said the february 22 louvre accord had produced ""satisfactory exchange rate stability,"" in part thanks to heavy coordinated intervention of group of seven central banks, and he was ""content"" with sterling's exchange rate.     pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in u.k. may currency reserves announced today he said, ""we have been playing a very full part ourselves ... we have been intervening to a very much greater extent than we had done hitherto.""     lawson said there was a risk that the louvre agreement may falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic commitments underlying the accord.     ""certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their commitments in paris ... in this respect."" he said the u.s. budget deficit was ""very important.""     noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by japanese prime minister yasuhiro nakasone last week lawson said, ""what is really needed in japan is an increase in merchandise imports. supply side measures are critical.""     ""there is a specific range of consumer and agricultural goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is wholly unjustified,"" he said.     lawson doubted that tokyo's partners would indulge in ""japan bashing"" at the summit especially after the economic stimulation package and the announcement of nakasone's plans to increase japanese development aid over the next three years.     japan's more flexible stance on tokyo stock exchange membership would also help deflect criticism, he said.     he said he thought west germany would instead come under pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to jack up faltering economic growth.     in this respect lawson said he hoped bonn would bring forward to january 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts scheduled for 1990. he also called on bonn to push ahead with the privatisation of german national industries.     on debt, lawson said he expected a three point british plan to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to make progress in venice.     the plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign debt in the paris club, was first proposed at the imf and world bank meetings in washington earlier this year.     lawson said he would seek ""to consolidate political backing for the plan at the venice summit"" and hoped the programme would be finalised at the autumn meetings of the imf and world bank.     he welcomed the recent moves by citicorp and chase manhattan to increase sharply their third world debt provisions.     ""first, it is a blow for realism. second, because the market response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this sort of move than they felt before citicorp,"" he said.     u.k. banks should follow bank of england recommendations, strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions. ""they have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,"" lawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves to determine the appropriate size of provisions.     he also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be discussed at the summit.

1061,"talking point/purolator courier corp <pcc> purolator courier corp's stock rose on specualtion that a disgruntled former purolator director would find a new suitor for the company, traders said.     purolator agreed in late february to a 35 dlr-a-share, 265 mln-dlr offer from e.f. hutton lbo inc and certain members of its purolator courier division's management.     the stock today hit 36-1/4, up one.     today, purolator revealed in a filing with the securities and exchange commission that director doresy gardner resigned from its board of directors in a letter dated march 10.     the letter from gardner said he resigned the board because the merger agreement with hutton barred directors from soliciting new offers and he believes shareholders might get a better deal. gardner said he believes a better offer might be found if the company would agree to be sold to some other entity, or if it could sell off all or part of its u.s. courier division.     ""basically, (the courier division) is a company that has 450 mln dlrs in revenues. it's a very large company and it's being sold for 50 or 60 mln dlrs,"" said gardner in a telephone interview with reuters.     gardner is an official of kelso management, a firm associated with fidelity international ltd. a group of fidelity companies owns eight pct of purolator, and gardner said he personally owns 20,000 shares.     a purolator official said the company has no comment on the letter from gardner.     arbitragers speculated another overnight messenger service may emerge as a likely bidder for purolator. before the transaction with hutton lbo was announced, analysts had also speculated another courier company would be the most likely suitor.     while one arbitrager acknowledged there in fact may be no new bidders, he said the possibility one could appear pushed the stock into play again.     ""there's no shortage of possibilities. it's just a question of management's willingness to let the process continue,"" said one arbitrager.     arbitragers said a new buyer might be found because they believe hutton lbo has taken on no risk in the transaction. hutton has begun a tender for 83 pct of purolator at 35 dlrs cash per share. the balance of purolator's stock will be bought for securities and warrants in a new company holding the u.s. courier operations.     the arbitragers said tender offer documents show that hutton does not need to use its cash in the transaction and will emerge with a giant, majority equity interest in purolator.     ""as far as i can tell from the public documents from the deal that's on the table, hutton is basically putting up zero. one always likes a situation like that. you always like to think if they can do this deal at no risk, there should be someone else in the world that could do it higher,"" said one arbitrager.     the firm, however, is supplying temporary financing, and sources close to the transaction disputed the claim that the firm will not end up paying for its equity position.     while one scenario mentioned in the tender offer document did note that the e.f. hutton group subsidiary may not have to keep cash in the transaction, the sources said there is some risk to the firm.     ""there are a variety of contingencies and restricted cash, and all sorts of things that make it very speculative,"" said one of the sources, adding there are also severance payments to employees.     the e.f. hutton group subsidiary is supplying 279 mln dlrs in so-called ""bridge"" financing for the transaction. the bridge financing is a temporary loan from hutton.     the financing is to be replaced with permanent financing, expected to come from banks. however, it may take some time to replace the financing, the source said, resulting in what could be a substantial expense to the firm.     gardner said hutton stands to gain fees of 10 to 20 mln dlrs from the transaction, but sources close to the transaction said fees are at the low end of the scale.     ""it's a very complex transaction, but basically what happens is they ostensibly put up money but the fees recapture any investment they might have once the merger takes place,"" gardner said.  reuter ;","('acq',)","('acq',)"

""the purpose of the report is to make clear that trade practices which impede exports are not a unique problem only faced by u.s. exporters. europeans face similar problems in the u.s.,"" it said.     among the obstacles detailed in the report are import restrictions on food products, such as cheese, sugar and syrup, certain wines, beers and juices, as well as on firearms and machine tools.     it also criticises programs to boost u.s. cereals exports. the document said the u.s.'s three-year export enhancement program (eep), which began in 1985, had subsidised exports of 9.7 mln tonnes of wheat, two mln tonnes of wheat flour and 2.8 mln tonnes of barley up to mid-march this year. the subsidies granted so far were worth about 620 mln dlrs, it added.

1122,"german wage round said to limit monetary options the bundesbank's options for west germany monetary policy are limited for the foreseeable future by the delicate stage of wage negotiations between unions and employers, economists and money market dealers said.     call money fell in quite active trading today, dropping to 3.40/50 pct from 3.55/65 pct yesterday, and below the 3.50 pct treasury bill rate as a difficult month-end approached.     but dealers and economists said the bundesbank was unlikely to encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely for fear of upsetting the current wage round.     one money market dealer for a major foreign bank said, ""i don't think the bundesbank wants rates to go up whatever happens. but it also does not want them to fall. above all it wants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes.""     in west germany, unions and employers prepare the ground for triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessments of growth and inflation, economists said.     ute geipel, economist with citibank ag, said if the bundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy, raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in the medium term, unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands.     as a result the bundesbank was concerned to make no move that would interfere in the negotiating process, geipel said.     in the current round, the country's most powerful union, the ig metall representing metalworkers and engineers, is demanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from the present 38-1/2 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages.     the engineering employers' association, gesamtmetall, is offering to bring in a 38-hour-week from july 1, 1988, and give a two stage wage increase -- a 2.7 pct rise from april 1 this year and another 1.5 pct from july 1, 1988.     the agreement forged by ig metall -- europe's largest union, with 2.5 mln members -- and the employers would set the benchmark for settlements in other industries such as the public sector, banks and federal post office. negotiations began in december and unions are hopeful they may conclude by early april, ahead of the traditional holiday period in june.     though many economists said the unions' current warning strikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy and would not lead to a repeat of 1984's damaging seven-week strikes, others said unions would not compromise greatly on their positions and there could still be conflict.     this could extend the length of time in which the bundesbank would keep its activity low-key, economists said.     the money market head said the unions' humiliation by the protracted financial problems of the neue heimat cooperative housing venture would contribute to union obstinacy.     ""the unions haven't forgotten that and they will put this squarely onto the account in the negotiations,"" he said.     in addition, the newly-elected chairman of the ig metall union, franz steinkuehler, was more radical and determined than his predecessor hans meyer and may be set for a longer battle to achieve the best possible settlement for his membership.     more than 16,000 engineering workers at 45 firms, mainly in south germany, held warning strikes lasting up to two hours yesterday. firms hit included zahnradfabrik passau gmbh and aerospace group messerschmitt-boelkow-blohm gmbh.     today, 28,000 employees from 110 companies came out in warning strikes, a statement from ig metall said.     money market dealers said that overnight call money rates would rise in the near future in any case and did not depend on a politically-inhibited bundesbank.     about eight billion marks were coming into the market tomorrow from salary payments by the federal government.     as a result, some banks fell back on the bundesbank's offer to mop up liquidity via the sale of three-day treasury bills, anticipating still lower rates before the month-end.     but a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customers was due on monday, other dealers noted. if banks were short of liquidity until the bills matured on tuesday, rates could soar, perhaps to the 5.50 pct lombard ceiling.     banks were well stocked up with funds, having an average 52.1 billion marks in bundesbank minimum reserves in the first 24 days of march, well above the 50.7 billion requirement.  reuter ;","('money-fx',)","('interest',)"

""eventually the ministry will get what it wants -- one combined competitor,"" bache securities (japan) ltd analyst darrell whitten said.

1157,"ecuador to export no oil for four months, official the suspension of ecuador's crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior energy ministry official said.     the official said ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at lago agrio to balao on the pacific coast. it would take about 100 mln u.s. dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, told reuters. ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.     the earthquake last thursday night registered six on the 12-point international mercalli scale. the damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues.     financially pressed ecuador, a member of the organisation of petroleum exporting countries (opec), was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another energy ministry spokesman said. last year, it exported an average of 173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.     however, ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a colombian pipeline, the first official said. he estimated it could take about 60 days to build.     ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of january, about equal to one month's imports.     it suspended interest payments in january on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. the country's total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in latin america.     in caracas, president jaime lusinchi said venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.     ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to venezuela in repayment in may, lusinchi said.     a commission headed by venezuelan investment fund minister hector hurtado and including representatives from the interior and defence ministries and the state oil company petroleos de venezuela will travel to ecuador tuesday to evaluate and co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.  reuter ;","('crude',)","('crude',)"

1176,"u.k. reserves lift hopes of further base rate cut the record 4.9 billion dlrs rise in u.k. reserves in may to a total 34.7 billion has lifted hopes for a further cut in bank base lending rates after the june 11 general election, market analysts said.     sterling would have risen on the much better than expected number but for market nerves about the poll outcome, they said.     but the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves now available to the authorities to support the pound should curb any market tendency to panic if u.k. opinion polls show the ruling conservative party's lead slipping, they added.     ""we have been intervening to a very much greater extent than we have done hitherto,"" chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson said at a news conference today, commenting on the news of the record reserves rise.     he put the u.k. intervention in the context of the louvre accord between leading industrial nations to stabilise the dollar, partly through direct intervention on foreign exchanges. ""we have been playing a very full part ourselves,"" he said.     but market analysts see the recent upward pressure on sterling, and consequent need for official sales to damp down its rise, more in the light of local factors.     steven bell, chief economist at morgan grenfell securities, said that corporate money has been flowing back into britain amid hopes of another conservative government, after fears last autumn of a labour election victory sent it flooding out.     u.k. portfolio investment is also returning, while foreign buyers see u.k. growth propects and high bond yields as attractive. they will be strong buyers of u.k. assets, notably equities, once the election is out of the way, bell said.     analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lower interest rates, as the government is expected to try to reverse the loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound.     today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reserves news, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket of currencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 gmt to 73.0 pct at 1100 gmt, half an hour after the figures were released.     ""the market doesn't want to do anything because of the election,"" commented an economist at a big u.s. investment bank.     several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts of a rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs had overestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely to have been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on the forward market.     the market also seemed to have overestimated the amount of sterling the bank of england bought at the end of may to smooth the pound's sudden downturn, while some of the intervention reported in may probably occurred in april, they said.     the key three months interbank money market rates eased about 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrend in u.k. interest rates will be revived following the reserves news, analysts said.     government bond prices initially firmed, but the market was muted as traders worried about the funding implications of another huge rise in reserves, they added.     morgan grenfell's bell forecast a half point base rate cut from the current nine pct level soon after the election, so long as poll projections of another conservative victory prove accurate, with another half point later.     justin silverton, equity economist at credit suisse buckmaster and moore, said a full point reduction might be possible. ""sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts in future, rather than this active intervention,"" he predicted.     kevin boakes of greenwell montagu gilt-edged cautioned against over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cut looked likely.     a cut before the election has been virtually ruled out.     ""the bank (of england) is both worried about the political problem of cutting rates during an election campaign ... and has signalled some worry about broad money (growth),"" said robin marshall, chief u.k. economist at chase manhattan securities.     he said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves in the past seven months may foreshadow full u.k. entry into the european monetary system.     but bell said the authorities would like to see another 10 or 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining, if they did so. but, unlike many analysts, he doubted the u.k. will go in.  reuter ;","('interest', 'reserves')","('interest',)"

""it is the other way round,"" valentchits said.     he said the development bank of the philippines (dbp) and the philippine national bank (pnb), which own nmic, had approached the soviet state-owned firm in august last year.

""m-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness,"" said bill sullivan of dean witter reynolds inc.     while m-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of economic growth, sullivan said fed officials might be concerned the latest drop in m-1 means another month of sluggish growth in the broader monetary aggregates, m-2 and m-3, which are seen as better gauges of economic growth.     latest monthly m-2 and m-3 data showed that as of may, both measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the fed's 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.     if money growth does not accelerate, fed officials, concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging, could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.     ""does this mean that the fed abandons its current open market position? no,"" sullivan said. ""but does this mean the end of tightening for the time being? definitely yes.""     economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings of 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period were lower than they had expected. most believed the fed had targetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs.     but they said that if it had not been for a large one-day net miss in the fed's reserve projections, the higher borrowings target would probably have been reached.     a drop in may u.s. housing starts and continued weakness in auto sales show key sectors of the u.s. economy are lagging, while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in may producer prices has helped dispel inflation fears, slifer said.     ""if this continues, we can entertain the notion of fed easing at some point,"" he said.     other economists said the fed would probably pay little attention to weak money supply growth. ""it has been a number of years since m-1 has given good signs of what's going on in the economy,"" one said. ""i don't think m-1 shows that the economy is falling apart and the fed should ease.""     economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a prerequisite for any move by the fed toward easier monetary policy.     they said the fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates for fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and higher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke off econmomic growth.     but sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late april. ""the fed has to determine if this represents a fundamental change for the dollar. if it does, then this gives them more room to ease,"" he said.  reuter ;","('dlr', 'money-fx', 'money-supply')","('money-supply',)"

""tit-for-tat"" policy that gave iran the initiative, said harlan ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with csis.     he said with this appraoch america would suffer ""the death of one thousand cuts.""     but for the united states to grab the initiative militarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining iran's harbors or blockading the mouth of the gulf through which its shipping must pass, schuler said.     he was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing iran to the neogtiating table. if vital supplies were cut off, tehran could not continue the war with iraq.     ullman said washington should join moscow in a diplomatic initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an arms embargo against tehran if it refused to negotiate.     he said the united states should also threaten to mine and blockade iran if it continued fighting and must press iraq to acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a settlement.     iranian and western diplomats say iraq started the war by invading iran's territory in 1980. iraq blames iran for the outbreak of hostilities, which have entailed world war i-style infantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties.     each side has attacked the others' shipping.  reuter ;","('crude', 'ship')","('crude', 'ship')"

""it's 99.9 pct (certain)--i guarantee you a strike,"" roman gralewicz, head of the seafarers' canadian branch, has said.     the canadian government has called in a labor conciliator to try to hammer out a contract agreement between the two sides. the seaway authority said a walkout tying up ships on the great lakes would badly hurt traffic.     ""we haven't had a strike on the seaway for years...a prolonged strike would have a disasterous effect,"" seaway authority spokeswoman gay hemsley said.     ""these are the heaviest contract talks in the history of the st lawrence seaway,"" george miller, vice-president of the canadian lake carriers association, an association of major canadian shipping companies, said recently.     the workers' current contract expires may 31. the association said it is asking for a five per cent cut in wages for the next three years, reduced crew levels and the power to restructure crew dispatching.     the association said its members recorded about a 6 mln dlrs (u.s.) loss in each of 1985 and 1986 due to lower traffic and freight rates and increasing competition. the seaway said 1985 was its worst year in two decades.     hemsley said the seaway authority plans to raise tolls on the welland canal by eight pct this year, compared to last year's 15 pct rise, while maintaining a freeze on tolls throughout the rest of the waterway.     canada is responsible for 13 of the seaway's 15 locks and about 85 pct of its revenues and maintenance costs.     ""we may see and hope for a steady upward climb...but we won't see a major increase for a number of years,"" hemsley said.     a canada-u.s. delegation to promote the seaway to shippers in western europe should result in some increased traffic this season but the full benefits won't be felt for several years, blair said.  reuter ;","('grain', 'ship')","('ship',)"

1250,"australia expects rise in meat exports to mideast australia expects meat and livestock exports to the middle east to maintain an upward trend this year, managing director of the australian meat and livestock corp, peter frawley, said.     he told reuters an improvement in the economic climate and less competition from the european community should lead in the gulf area to higher beef sales, which dropped from 33,000 tonnes in 1980 to just 2,300 tonnes last year.     ""in the last three to four months there has been a resurgence of inquiries,"" he said.     frawley is on a gulf tour which will also take him to saudi arabia, the united arab emirates and kuwait to assess market potential.     on beef exports, he said a 50 pct drop in european community intervention stock in the past 12 months would help australian sales.     the fall meant the ec was not as aggressive in these markets, where the australian trade was the natural source of supply, and australia was ""now back in,"" frawley said.     he said there was a debate in australia as to whether the middle east market for livestock, which accounts for two-thirds of meat export value to the area, would be maintained.     he believed the trade would remain with a continuing demand for fresh meat.     the number of live sheep shipped last year to saudi arabia, the biggest single market, was 3,214,159 compared with 2,939,226 in 1985. the numbers shipped to the united arab emirates and bahrain fell, however.     frawley said the slackening in demand in the gulf had been offset by other arab countries around the mediterranean.     other than livestock, australia's overall meat sales to the middle east rose to 72,374 tonnes in 1986 from 52,403 tonnes the previous year, largely due to the sale of 25,790 tonnes of mutton and lamb to iran.     australia sold 9,824 tonnes to iran in 1985 after being virtually excluded by new zealand competition for several years. frawley said the 1986 sale contract had included a barter provision, but iran had paid in full in cash.     negotiations with the iranians for 1987 shipments were currently under way, with iran again seeking credit and barter provisions, he said.     frawley said there had been a tremendous growth in demand for chilled lamb in the last four to five years and he predicted this would continue.

1255,"numerous factors said point to ussr corn buying a greater than anticipated need, competitive prices and political motivations could be sparking soviet interest in u.s. corn, industry and government officials said.     as rumors circulated through grain markets today that the soviet union has purchased an additional 1.5 mln tonnes of u.s. corn, industry and government sources noted a number of factors that make soviet buying of u.s. corn likely.     first, there are supply concerns. some trade sources said recent speculation has been that last year's soviet grain crop be revised to only 190 mln tonnes, rather than the 210 mln announced, therby increasing the soviet need for grain.     a drop in argentine corn crop prospects could also affect soviet corn buying, an agriculture department source said.     dry weather in argentina -- a major corn supplier to the ussr -- and reported crop problems prompted usda to lower its argentine 1986/87 corn crop estimate this week to 11.0 mln tonnes, down from 11.5 mln. argentina corn exports were also cut by 500,000 tonnes to 6.8 mln tonnes.     argentina has already committed four mln tonnes of this year's corn for export, a usda official said, with two mln tonnes of that booked for april-june delivery to the ussr.     ""significant downside potential"" still exists for the argentine crop, the official said, which will decrease the amount of additional corn that country can sell to moscow.     ""if the soviet needs are greater than we have been thinking, then they might need more than what argentina can provide during the april to june period,"" he said.     current competitive prices for u.s. corn have also sparked soviet buying.     u.s. corn was reported to be selling on the world market earlier this week for around 71 dlrs per tonne, argentine corn for 67 dlrs -- a very competitive price spread, u.s. and soviet sources said.     ""this price difference makes american corn competitive,"" albert melnikov, commercial counselor for the soviet union, told reuters.     impending crop problems in argentina will likely cause those prices to rise, and with the recently strong u.s. corn futures prices, the soviets might feel corn prices have bottomed and that this is a good time to buy, sources said.     finally, some industry sources said that by buying the minimum amount of corn guaranteed under the u.s./ussr grains agreement (four mln tonnes), the soviet union may be hoping to convince the usda to offer moscow a subsidy on wheat.     in an inteview with reuters this week, usda secretary richard lyng said that no decision had been made on a wheat subsidy offer, but that such an offer had not been ruled out.  reuter ;","('corn', 'grain')","('corn', 'grain')"

""we are willing, even eager, to make a fair market value offer in cash for the southern pacific,"" said kansas city southern president and chief executive officer landon h. rowland.     ""this offer disproves the constant derogation of the sourthern pacific by sfsp management, best exemplified by sfsp chief executive john schmidt's comment in icc hearings that the southern pacific was 'bankrupt,'"" said rowland.     he said that merging southern with kansas city will achieve the benefits of an end-to-end merger while preseving the independece of the southern pacific versus its existing prime competitor, santa fe.     kansas said that southern's management had estimated the value of the railroad in 1983 in the range of 281 mln dlrs to 1.2 billion dlrs.     it said that morgan stanley and co inc and salomon brothers inc, hired in 1983 to advise southern and santa fe in their merger, appraised southern as worth between 500 mln dlrs and 800 mln dlrs less than southern's own internal valuations.     kanasa city southern said it will make an offer for southern after its books, records and properties are examined.     ""once that examination has been completed (and even in the absence of a willingnes of sfsp to negotiate) kcsi will make an offer in writing...."" said the company.     kansas also said it argued in the icc filing that santa fe had not met the legal requirements justifying the commission's reconsideration of the proposed merger of santa fe and southern pacific, two railroads that it said basically parallel each other throughout their routes.     icc voted four to one last summer to reject the merger as inherently anticompetitive. kansas said santa fe in petitioning for reconsideration now argues that the trackage agreements with the union pacific, the denver and rio grande western and other railroads, adds to the value of the merger.  reuter ;","('acq',)","('acq',)"

""we believe there has been wise leadership here and the economy is being very well managed,"" conable told reporters at jakarta airport.     indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling 37 billion dlrs, according to the bank, which makes it the third world's sixth biggest debtor. it has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the world bank since 1968.     conable did not spell out what further changes he would like to see. last month the bank endorsed economic changes already introduced by indonesia, but implied it wanted more.     giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support, the bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of the government's trade reform measures, and supported its determination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth.     indonesia has introduced a series of measures since last may to boost non-oil exports, liberalise trade and encourage outside investment.     suharto has also ordered a government committee to look into which of indonesia's 215 state-run companies could be sold.     but in a report last month, the u.s. embassy said the government appeared divided over how far to take its reforms.     western analysts say that in particular the government is unsure how far to go with dismantling indonesia's high-cost monopolies, which control core areas of the economy.     central bank governor arifin siregar said this week that indonesia faced very limited economic choices.     it could not spend its way out of trouble because this would increase the balance of payments deficit and domestic inflation.      he said the main objective was to raise exports outside the oil and natural gas sector.     indonesia's current account deficit is projected by the government to fall to 2.64 billion dlrs in the coming financial year which starts on april 1, from an estimated 4.1 billion in 1986/87.  reuter ;","('crude',)","('trade',)"

1304,"economic spotlight - china must preserve farmland ""if we go on using up farmland as we have done since 1980, there will be none left in 20 years to grow grain on.""     xu jinfeng, a middle-aged official in fengbang village on the edge of shanghai, sums up the dilemma china faces as it tries to feed its more than one billion people and at the same time let them get richer by building factories and new homes.     china has to feed one quarter of the world's population, but only one seventh of its land is arable.     sharp increases in farm output since 1979 turned china into a net grain exporter for the first time in 1985, and again in 1986.     but the rapid industrialisation of the countryside which has occurred at the same time, has gobbled up arable land for factories and homes for peasants who can now afford them.     official figures show that china lost just under one pct of its arable land to other uses in 1985 and a slightly smaller amount last year. it gained 26 mln new mouths to feed during the two years.     ""we lost very little land prior to 1980 when the industrialisation began,"" official xu said. ""since then, nearly all the families in the county have built new homes and many factories have gone up.""     ""last year we lost land to a new railway line,"" xu said. but land losses in future should fall because nearly all families already have new houses, she added.     the issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the peking leadership, which announced earlier this month that china will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land for the first time this year.     ""the present situation of abusing, occupying unlawfully, wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious,"" said an article in the official press explaining the new measures.     ""it has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland,"" it said. ""china has a large population and its land resources are badly deficient.""     an official of the shanghai city government said county authorities could approve conversion of only 0.3 hectares of arable land to other uses, while anything more than that must be approved by the city government.    the peking government faces another major obstacle in its efforts to ensure china's people get enough grain to eat. the prices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low, making it more profitable for them to grow other crops.     to offset this, the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser and diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to buy. the state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to china's 200 mln city residents. rural factories also subsidise grain output, paying farmers bonuses to grow it.     some officials argue that the simplest solution to the problem would be for the state to raise city grain prices.     chen zuyuan, communist party secretary of a village in the eastern province of zhejiang, said the government listened too much to the demands of ""selfish city people"" and could raise city grain prices without any problem.     but the government has ruled out a price rise. ""raising the price of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social stability,"" said a china daily editorial this month.     the shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the long term. ""we must be very careful. we have a very large population which is used to price stability and will object to price rises,"" he said. ""the problem is how to do it.""     the shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might also affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with grain and consumed by city residents.     in addition, the state faces the problem of inadequate investment by farmers in land and in grain in particular.     the official press has reported that farmers fear farm policy may change and they are putting their new wealth into building graves, memorial halls for ancestors and homes.     under reforms introduced in the late 1970s, farmers sign contracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops, but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land.     ""as the expiration date of the 15-year contract is almost at the halfway mark, farmers are beginning to worry about the future,"" the china daily said in an editorial last month.     their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to use the land but not own it. for most of the period of communist rule, the land was organised into collectives where there was little room for individual initiative.     ""new measures are needed to reassure them of the consistency of government policies and make them interested in long-term investment,"" the newspaper said.  reuter ;","('grain',)","('trade',)"

""generally speaking, we are overbanked in qatar,"" he said, echoing a widespread feeling in the banking community.     other local banks fared less strongly. the second largest, <doha bank ltd qsc>, reported a 13 pct drop in net profit to 27.5 mln riyals, while <commercial bank of qatar ltd qsc>, registered a decline to 18.5 mln riyals from 19.4 mln in 1985.     the newcomer al ahli bank, continued to expand rapidly and reported net profit of 5.2 mln compared with 3.3 mln during the start-up period from august 4, 1984 to end-1985.     bankers said the local banks had clearly begun to win commercial deposits previously held by foreign banks, increasing already strong pressure on non-qatari banks to reexamine their staffing levels and overheads.     <grindlays bank plc> recorded a net loss at its doha branch last year of 4.7 mln riyals after registering a nominal profit in 1985 of 12,000 riyals.     two other long-established banks in the gulf, the <british bank of the middle east> (bbme) and standard chartered, also found last year a difficult climate to make strong profits.     bbme""s net profit fell to 3.2 mln riyals from 10.4 mln in 1985, but assistant manager john farquharson said 1985""s result had been artificially inflated by tax rebates on provisions.

1320,"house farm leader sees billion dlr budget cuts the 1988 agriculture budget will have to be cut by an additional one to two billion dlrs, the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee said.     implementation of a 0/92 program, a tightening up of the use of commodity certificates, and reconstitution of farms are possibilities that will be studied to reduce farm spending, said dan glickman, d-kans., chairman of the house agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains.     speaking at the annual meeting of the national grain and feed association, glickman said he learned this week from the house budget committee that the agriculture committee will have to reduce the fiscal year 1988 farm budget by up to two billion dlrs from the 30 billion dlrs level already approved.     decisions on how to cut the farm budget will have to be made very quickly in order to make any impact on the fy 1988 budget, glickman added.     glickman also said his committee will not approve usda's  proposal to cut target prices by ten pct per year.     ""the administration's target price proposals are dead in the water,"" he said.     to cut the budget, glickman said, ""everthing is on the table,"" except those moves that would reduce farmers' income.     glickman offered a list of possibilities that his committee will study in order to cut farm spending.     implementation of a 0/92 program for 1987 winter wheat and 1988 feedgrains crops has been introduced by glickman, which he said would result in a 150-200 mln dlr savings for one year.     tightening up on the use of generic (in-kind, or ""pik') certificates will also be another option his committee will study, glickman said.     while not committing himself for or against such action, he said lawmakers have to examine recent government findings which indicate certificates cost more than cash payments.     glickman said rules for the reconstitution of farms and tightening up of the person definition for annual payment limitations is another option and could save 100-200 mln dlrs.     he also said increasing acreage set-aside requirements by five pct for wheat and feedgrains at program sign-up was a move that could save about one billion dlrs, but added that he would not be in favor of such a change.     glickman also said that the export enhancement program's, eep, spending authority of 1.5 billion dlrs is quickly being used up, and congress will have to decide whether to expand this program while making cuts in other areas.     cuts in the eep program are unlikely, he said.

""this has not been good for coffee producers, more so in a situation where the prices dropped by 200 pounds per tonne of robusta coffee,"" j. makumbi said when he returned from london on friday.     producers and consumers failed to agree on a quota formula to share the world's coffee production during international coffee organisation, ico, talks that ended last week.     makumbi blamed the failure to set quotas, which were suspended in feburary last year, on indonesian demands that its quota be increased dramatically.     uganda -- which earns about 400 mln dlrs annually from coffee exports, over 95 pct of its foreign exchange earnings -- had sought to raise its ico quota to 3.0 mln from 2.45 mln 60-kilo bags, according to sources close to the cmb.     the cmb has estimated that production will rise 20 to 25 pct in the current 1986/87 october-september season to over three mln bags.     for several years uganda had been unable to meet its ico export quota as rebel activity disrupted the coffee industry.     the ugandan government depends on coffee export duties for about 60 pct of its sales tax revenue and the industry employs over half of salaried manpower.     in dar es salaam, tanzania's agriculture and livestock development minister paul bomani said today third world countries would suffer from the failure of the london coffee talks.

usda lifts cross-compliance for 1987 crop oats
    repeat from late friday
    washington, feb 27 - the usda said it is lifting the
limited cross-compliance requirement for 1987 crop oats.
    deputy secretary peter myers said the action was being
taken to help alleviate the short supply of oats.
    under limited cross compliance, the plantings of other
program crops on the farm may not exceed the crop acreage bases
of those crops.
    the lifting of the cross-compliance on oats permits the
planting of oats in excess of the oat acreage base without
sacrificing eligibility for other crop program benefits.
    myers said soybean plantings are expected to decrease as a
result of the action on oats, planting of which are expected to
increase by two to three mln acres.

""on balance, it is as if nothing happened ... we are back to where we were before,"" mark brett, economist at securities house barclays de zoete wedd said.     ""this whole story is like a storm in a teacup,"" a dealer with a u.k. bank commented.     the pound's recovery was triggered when lawson criticised media coverage of comments he made yesterday, when he told a conference he wanted sterling to stay roughly where it was.     in this context, lawson was reported to have specified rates of around 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs to the pound in remarks which markets were quick to interpret as a signal to sell sterling.     lawson said today he had merely stated yesterday's approximate value of the pound.     ""the wrong end of the stick was picked up,"" he told reporters, adding his comments did in no way signal a change in british exchange rate policies.     dealers and analysts said the reactions to both statements were clear evidence that the market, frustrated by the relative currency stability after the february 22 paris agreement, was desperate to reactivate trading and would react to any clues offered about the contents of the currency accord.     in paris, finance ministers of the group of five and canada are widely believed to have agreed exchange rate targets, although no participant has specified these in an apparent bid to foster stability by keeping markets guessing.     ""the markets are absolutely desperate to get clues on group of six (countries that are part to the paris agreement) targets ... the number of rumours flying around is bigger than ever before,"" said barclays de zoete wedd's brett.     analysts said neither yesterday's remarks nor today's had changed their impression that after paris, sterling was targeted to trade in broad ranges against major currencies.      all polled analysts said if anything, the 2.90 marks level mentioned by lawson was probably the centre of a wide 20-pfennig range which sterling would easily hold, helped by good economic indicators and relatively high interest rates.     ""it would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an election ... i don't believe lawson is mad enough to tie himself to a fixed rate,"" brett said. he expected sterling to firm over the next few weeks, to around 2.95 marks and 1.63 dlrs, as overseas investors reappraised high-yielding investments here.     robin marshall, chief economist at chase manhattan securities, said he was not surprised to see lawson qualify his sterling target comments so quickly.     ""his remarks gave markets a target to aim at,"" he said, adding, ""he (lawson) talked himself into a bit of a corner on this ... it made him a hostage to fortune.""     marshall and other analysts dismissed a theory, that by quoting target rates lawson had attempted to put pressure on prime minister margaret thatcher to agree to british membership of the european monetary system (ems), as implausible.  reuter ;","('money-fx', 'stg')","('money-fx',)"
1382,"ec agrees on need to strengthen ems european community (ec) finance ministers and central bankers agreed on the need for greater cooperation to strengthen the european monetary system (ems) against international market turbulence, officials said.     ""there was a general will to reinforce the european monetary system, with all that implies,"" belgian finance minister mark eyskens said yesterday after hosting a one-day session of informal talks at this belgian coastal resort.     the gathering was the first such discussion since the second major realignment of ems parities within nine months in january.     the system has come under severe strain as funds have flowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant ems currency, the west german mark, sending it soaring against weaker currencies in the system.     but eyskens said february's agreement between leading western industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates at around current levels was working and this would allow the ec to speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of the ems.     he told a news conference yesterday's meeting agreed on the need for closer coordination among ems member governments of interest rate policies and of interest rate differentials between different countries.     they also agreed they needed better coordination of exchange market intervention to hold currencies stable, both when they reached their fixed ems limits and within their agreed margins.     but eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range of technical problems and ministers would discuss these further in luxembourg in june on the basis of proposals from the ec's monetary committee and committee of central bank governors.     he said the ec needed a set of indicators of economic convergence betwen community countries and it was important that interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchange rates and inflation rates.     the belgian minister, whose country presently holds the presidency of the community, made clear the meeting had not produced any agreement to move radically forward in developing the ems towards the ec's long term goal of economic and monetary integration.     ""we have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normal functioning of the system,"" eyskens said.     eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the ems has to be reinforced if the ec's plans to liberalise all movements of capital across national borders by 1992 are to go ahead.     ec executive commission president jacques delors told the meeting the authority would put forward proposals for a final phase of capital market liberalisation in october that would include safeguard clauses for member countries for which the move would create difficulties.     eyskens said the ministers and central bankers also discussed the need to ""dedramatise"" realignments of ems parities by letting high-ranking monetary officials carry them out by telephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers.     however, west german sources said bonn finance minister gerhard stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea.     british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson told journalists that one of the technical issues raised by greater coordination of exchange market intervention was the question of which currencies should be used to intervene and held in central bank reserves.     he said several ems member countries believed the ems would work better if central banks held each other's currencies -- an issue of particular importance regarding west germany since the bundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves.     he said the debate on dedramatising ems realignments reflected a general feeling among participants that the way the january reshuffle had been conducted was unsatisfactory.    the realignment was marked by acrimony between france and west germany, with each side blaming the other for strains in the system that forced the parity overhaul.  reuter ;","('money-fx',)","('money-fx',)"

""we're working very hard on this merger.""     hughes' board today again adjourned a shareholders meeting to vote on the proposed merger and rescheduled it for march 11 to give baker more time to consider the counter proposal.     the hughes board, which had previously expressed concern about a u.s. department of justice consent decree that would require baker to sell its drilling bit operations and submersible pump business, met yesterday and threatened to terminate the proposed merger.     the hughes board made a counter proposal that the two companies first find acceptable buyers for the businesses before signing the decree.     the directors of baker immediately after receiving the counter proposal filed a law suit in texas in a texas state court to force to hughes to complete the merger.     ""the uncertainty as to the price and conditions that might be imposed by the department of justice makes us very nervous about what the outcome might be,"" kistler said, in explaining why hughes had made the counter proposal.

1417,"german chemical industry sees lower profits west germany's chemical industry fears mounting risks will hurt earnings but hopes 1987 turnover will stabilize around 1986's 140 billion marks, josef strenger, a board member of the industry association vci, said.     strenger, management board chairman of bayer ag <bayg.f>, told a news conference at the hanover trade fair the main dangers were stagnation in world trade, the lower dollar as well as crude oil and commodity prices.     prospects of higher operating costs were also seen harming earnings, he said. turnover took a considerable downturn at the start of 1987 after falling 5.9 pct in 1986.     the chemical industry, which relies heavily on exports, was badly hit by mark appreciation in 1986 and lower turnover was mainly due to foreign exchange losses, strenger said.     exports fell 6.4 pct to 72 billion marks in 1986 and competition from u.s. and british firms increased. savings from lower oil and commodity prices were eaten up by price competition and increased costs.     strenger said 1986 operating profits of german chemical firms were slightly worse than the year before but the improved financial and balance sheet structure, after three good years, neutralized the negative impact.     strenger said the industry would try to increase production in the u.s. to make up for lost export possibilities out of west germany.     the lower dollar was the main reason for an 8.3 pct fall in exports to north america, an 11.4 pct drop to latin america and 22.6 pct plunge to the middle east.     exports to western europe eased 3.5 pct and far east exports, due to an economic revival in japan, dropped 5.2 pct.     strenger noted that the industry had lost public confidence following several cases of chemical pollution of the rhine late last year.  reuter ;","('earn',)","('trade',)"

1422,"no near term brazil coffee moves expected the brazilian coffee institute, ibc, is unlikely to disclose its future export policy until the end of next week at the earliest, trade sources said.     ibc president jorio dauster is meeting government ministers, producers, exporters and market analysts to assess brazil's position in the light of the failure of talks in london earlier this month to set new international coffee organization, ico, export quotas.     ""the failure of the talks means brazil has got to rethink its position completely,"" one santos exporter said.     a meeting of the national coffee policy council is set for thursday, march 19, and dauster will almost certainly explain his plan to members then before announcing any new measures.     dauster told reporters on his return from london last week that no decisions would be made on exports before he had held talks with all sectors of the industry.     exporters said dauster is not under any great pressure to start marketing coffee immediately. world prices have been recovering from the lows which followed the collapse of the ico talks and brazil has sold a reasonable 5.5 mln bags of 60 kilos for export in the first four months of this year.     the exporters said the key factor in the eventual opening of may and june export registrations will be the amount at which the contribution quota is set.     with little expectation of other sales incentive mechanisms such as discounts, bonuses and price fall guarantees being introduced, the level of the quota will be decisive in determining the competitiveness of brazilian coffee on world markets, they said.     they noted that on february 16, the eve of a planned increase in the quota, april registrations were opened and closed after 1.68 mln bags were registered for export, a record amount for a single day.     if may/june registrations are opened under similar conditions as before, brazil would have no difficulty in selling at least 2.0 mln bags per month.     ""the problem would be how to limit sales,"" one exporter said.     brazil's present foreign trade and payments problems mean there are pressures from the government to boost exports to maximise foreign exchange earnings.     however, the sources said they expect the ibc to adopt a marketing strategy aimed at regaining brazil's dominant position as an exporter, but without causing a price war.     general opinion among exporters was that brazil would plan to export between 17 and 18 mln bags this year of which between 1.5 and 2.0 mln would be to non-members of the ico.     the 15.5 mln to 16 mln bags sold to members would be around the figure brazil had offered to ship if ico quotas were reintroduced, although dauster has said this offer expired with the breakdown of talks.     with the prospects of a crop of at least 28 mln bags this year, brazil has the capacity to export up to 20 mln bags after meeting local consumption of around 7.0 mln, the sources added.     however, the sources said brazil is unlikely even to consider exporting such quantities, as this would almost inevitably lead to a fall in world prices as brazil tried to encroach on other producers' markets.     maximum export earnings would be achieved by orderly marketing of traditional amounts, thus re-establishing brazil's market share after last year's unusually low exports of 9.9 mln bags, enabling it to rebuild stocks and maintaining cordial relations with the producer group which backed brazil's stance at the ico talks, they added.  reuter ;","('coffee',)","('coffee',)"

""my guess is that supermarkets general does not want to be bought out,"" said ballan.     analysts, however, said supermarkets general is facing problems due to its purity supreme and rickels operations, which might make it difficult to thwart a bid.     supermarkets general is expected to report about 1.70 dlrs a share compared to a 1.73 dlrs a share reported for 1985 on a post stock split basis.     for the first quarter, comeau predicts the company will earn 39 cts a share from 35 cts a share a year ago, and should earn about 2.05 dlrs for 1987.     ""but that estimation could go to a 1.80 dlrs easily, due to purity supreme in new england,"" comeau said.     he said competition among supermarkets is getting heated in that area and that the company has had difficulty with integrating purity supreme with its pathmark store operations.     rickels, a home center business, has faced problems due to the state of that industry, and has reported lower returns as an operating unit, according to analysts.     analysts said that if dart buys supermarkets general it would probably divest the company's operations.     analyst comeau said ""supermarkets general may seek a combination with another supermarket company."" ;","('acq', 'earn')","('acq',)"

""the (outer continental shelf) leasing program fails to take into account the environmental performance of the oil industry,"" said bill bradford, executive vice president of dresser industries <di> and president of the petroleum equipment suppliers association.      huff quoted national academy of science figures showing offshore rigs contributed only two pct of petroleum pollution in the oceans, while tankers were responsible for 47 pct and municiple dumping 31 pct.

1434,"u.s. treasury policies said unchanged by departure the departure of james baker's closest aide, deputy treasury secretary richard darman, will not change the course of washington's domestic and international economic policies, u.s. officials said.     darman, who has worked alongside baker for six years, was widely credited with helping him mastermind initiatives on currency management and international economic cooperation.     u.s. officials said darman also played a key role in shepherding president reagan's sweeping tax reform plan through the u.s. congress.     but they flatly dismissed suggestions that his departure, to the investment banking firm of shearson lehman brothers, signaled the baker team was breaking up, or that the treasury secretary himself might leave soon.     ""it really does not mean that, he took the opportunity as it came up,"" one official said.     another commented, ""baker will miss him, but he's not going to stand in his way.""     there has been widespread speculation since last autumn that darman sought a wall street job.     officials said darman felt the passage of tax reform late last year marked an appropriate moment to bow out.     baker acknowledged darman would be sorely missed.     ""dick darman has contributed mightily to the success of this administration over the past six years and his departure represents a substantial loss,"" he said.     u.s. officials admitted darman's absence would be an undoubted blow to baker, who has relied on him for policy advice, both at the white house and, in reagan's second term, at the treasury. one aide once described darman as ""indispensable"" to baker.     baker is widely thought to want a more stable currency system and darman is generally credited by officials of other nations as baker's leading theorist on this issue, favouring target zones to limit currency fluctuations.     earlier this year, monetary sources said the u.s. treasury unsuccessfully sounded out allies on a target zone system.     but a u.s. official disputed the assessment that, with darman gone, baker would abandon international initiatives.     baker's work as head of reagan's economic policy council, spearheading trade policy, and his skills in negotiating with the democrat-controlled congress will go on as before.     darman's strength was not as an economist, but as a political strategist ""and that's baker's strength too,"" the official said.     there were already indications that baker, who throughout his time in government has relied on a closely-knit circle of advisers, has moved swiftly to find a successor.     one possibility is that baker might turn to george gould, who holds the number three treasury position of under-secretary.     gould, another close confidante, has known baker for years.     before joining the treasury in november 1985, gould was a partner at the wall steet firm of wertheim and co and formerly headed donaldson, lufkin and jenrette securities corp.     the darman announcement came on the eve of the semi-annual meetings of the international monetary fund and the world bank, where many policies darman helped shape will be debated.     he helped baker devise the september, 1985 plaza agreement, when the united states, japan, west germany, france and britain curbed the dollar's strength. the pact was a major turning point in u.s. policy, ending a period of disdain for economic cooperation and intervention in currency markets.     darman also worked on some other baker initiatives, like the tokyo summit agreement to intensify coordination of economic policies among the leading industrial countries and the recent paris agreement to stabilise currencies and stimulate global growth.     these policies are collectively aimed at redressing the huge gap between japan and west germany's trade surpluses and the united state's massive trade deficit.     that policy goal still remains a prime objective of the reagan administration and will not change with darman's departure.  reuter ;","('money-fx',)","('trade',)"

""there's a lot of speculation here that someway or other they would be forced to come up with another bid,"" said rosario ilaqua of l.f. rothschild.     and despite bp managing director david simon's denial today that bp would raise the offer, the analysts said that remained a distinct possibility.     analysts said they base their thinking on royal dutch/shell group's <rd> <sc> bid to buy the outstanding stake of shell oil co in 1984 and 1985. royal dutch/shell eventually raised its initial 55 dlrs a share offer to 60 dlrs a share, after lawsuits by minority shareholders.     ""i think they're going to have to go a little higher eventually, just as royal dutch/shell had to go a little higher for the shell oil minority shares,"" bruce lazier of prescott ball and turben said. he estimated a price of 75 dlrs a share.     royal dutch/shell offered 55 dlrs a share for the 30.5 pct of shell oil it did not already own in january of 1984. after objections from minority shareholders about the price, royal dutch/shell raised its bid and began a 58 dlrs a share tender offer in april 1984.     but shareholders sued and a court blocked completion of the offer. after months of wrangling over the worth of shell oil, royal dutch/shell agreed to another two dlrs increase.     it ended up paying 5.67 billion dlrs for the outstanding shell oil stake, a significant premium to its original bid of about 5.2 billion dlrs.     the analysts made their comments before simon's remarks at a bp press conference in new york this afternoon.     sanford margoshes of shearson lehman brothers inc told clients this morning that a sweetened offer was possible. the analyst said the bid could be raised by two dlrs a share.     analysts do not expect regulatory hurdles because of the royal dutch/shell group precedent. but there may be shareholder lawsuits for the same reason, they said.     goldman sachs and co, bp's investment advisor, advised the shell oil board in 1984 and 1985.  reuter ;","('acq', 'crude')","('acq',)"

1491,"bundesbank seen steering steady monetary course the bundesbank is likely to steer a steady monetary course over the next few weeks and a change in credit policies is not expected at tomorrow's regular central bank council meeting, bank economists and dealers said.     ""there is no need for action,"" hermann remsperger, chief economist of berliner handels- and frankfurter bank (bhf) said.     others noted that exchange rates are stable after last month's group of six agreement in paris and central bank money stock growth is still well above the three to six pct target zone, so a change in credit policies could be ruled out.     one money market dealer said comments by bundesbank president karl otto poehl at a private seminar in duesseldorf two weeks ago hinting at another interest rate cut only indicated the bundesbank might act if conditions changed.     bank economists said u.s. pressure on west germany to further ease credit policies had receded since the paris pact.     but such demands could re-emerge if west germany failed to stimulate its economy enough to affect the massive u.s. trade deficit.     remsperger said continued strong money supply growth also precluded a further cut in official interest rates.     central bank money stock was growing at an annualized 7.5 pct in february, unchanged from the 7.5 pct in january.     economists said some of the 18 members of the central bank council were worried about the continued overshoot in the money supply target and were bound to resist any moves to cut rates. but poehl played down the risk of inflation.     economists said the fact that money stock growth remained stable last month was a success. some said it was likely to return to within the target range later this year.     ""the special factors which boosted money supply growth last year are disappearing,"" one economist said.     he said some 75 pct of the money supply increase in 1986 was caused by a sharp rise in the inflow of foreign funds.     this trend had been reversed recently and with domestic credit demand likely to remain at steady levels, money stock growth was expected to narrow in the medium-term.     these developments were increasing the bundesbank's scope for a rate cut in the medium-term, economists said.     money market dealers said period rates remained little changed, indicating no change in credit policy was expected.     call money rates declined to 3.75/80 pct from 3.90/95 yesterday, with the market well stocked with liquidity.     dealers said call money was soft because tax payments on behalf of customers had been less than expected so far. but rates were likely to tighten again as soon as the full effect of this month's major tax payment period is felt. payments for the federal railways bond are also likely to burden the market.     the bundesbank did not inject liquidity via a securities repurchase agreement this week, but countered a tightening in rates on monday by injecting funds through government-owned banks.     dealers said recent securities repurchase pacts had shown the bundesbank clearly wanted call money rates stable at 3.80.     one dealer said, ""if the central bank wanted lower interest rates, it would first of all drive call money rates down.""     banks remained relatively well stocked with minimum reserve assets. they held 52.9 billion marks in minimum reserves on monday, averaging 53.7 billion marks over the first 16 days of march. a requirement of around 51 billion is expected.  reuter ;","('interest', 'money-fx')","('interest',)"

""it would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an election ... i don't believe lawson is mad enough to tie himself to a fixed rate,"" brett said.     currency markets were keen for official statements to clarify the scope of the paris accord and reactivate currency trading. this mood easily led to over-reaction, analysts said.     ""making similar statements when the market is high strung and ready to bounce is perhaps a mistake,"" one senior dealer with a u.s. bank said.     capel's skeoch said, ""it gives the foreign exchange markets something to shoot at.""     ""it is obvious that the government, as a member of the group of six, has agreed exchange rate bands. but they are not cut in stone, they can change with time,"" skeoch said.     brett said, ""we think the 2.90 marks level is a central rate. give or take 10 pfennigs and all is fine.""     not all analysts played down the significance of the remarks, however. chris dunn, economist at royal bank of canada, said the remarks may signal a decisive move to insulate sterling from the fortunes of the dollar.     although about two-thirds of britain's trade is conducted with european countries, sterling has traditionally shadowed the dollar rather than the mark, analysts noted.     ""britain must decide whether it wants to follow the u.s. or throw in its lot with europe,"" dunn said.     ""it suggests that while the u.k. is not actually applying to join the european monetary system, it is seeking protection by shadowing it ... the bundesbank has made it clear that it wants the u.k. to clarify its position relative to the mark,"" he said.     analysts said sterling's dip on currency markets following lawson's remarks made an early half-point cut in u.k. base rates from current 10 pct levels unlikely in the short term.     ""over the next three weeks, a cut is out, unless we get some extremely good economic indicators,"" capel's skeoch said.     base rates have been cut twice by one-half point in march, the last after the march 17 budget presentation, and analysts had been expecting another half point cut shortly afterwards.  reuter ;","('interest', 'money-fx', 'stg')","('interest',)"

1566,"fed data provide new evidence of tighter policy u.s. banking data released today are too distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary policy, but they do support the market's assumption that the federal reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit, economists said.     ""it's clear that the fed has firmed somewhat. discount window borrowings, net free reserves, the fed funds rate average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent with a modest tightening,"" said dana johnson of first chicago corp.     johnson, and several other economists, now estimate that the fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct.     discount window borrowings in the week to wednesday were 935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-week statement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week of december 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously.     moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billion dlrs from the fed on wednesday - the highest daily total this year - even though unexpectedly low treasury balances at the fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in reserves than the fed had anticipated.     however, economists said it is almost certain that the fed is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than witnessed this week. they pointed to two factors that may have forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week.     first, economists now expect m-1 money supply for the week ended april 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs, partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to pay annual income taxes.     as banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do the reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the fed.     required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billion dlrs a day in the two weeks ended wednesday, but economists said the fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the projected m-1 surge until late in the week and so started to add reserves too late.     second, an apparent shortage of treasury bills apparently left wall street dealers with too little collateral with which to enagage in repurchase agreements with the fed, economists said. thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of repos outstanding on wednesday night, the fed may have wanted to add even more reserves but was prevented from doing so.     ""it's not at all inconceivable that the fed didn't add as much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,"" said ward mccarthy of merrill lynch economics inc.     mccarthy estimated that the fed is now targetting discount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day, equivalent to a fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct.     after citing the reasons why the fed probably has not tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data, economists said the fact that the fed delayed arranging  overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy.     jeffrey leeds of chemical bank had not been convinced that the fed was tightening policy. but after reviewing today's figures, he said, ""it's fair to say that the fed may be moving toward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture.""     leeds expects fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct and said the fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate unless the dollar's fall gathers pace.     johnson at first chicago agreed, citing political opposition in washington to a dollar-defense package at a time when congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to reducing the u.s. trade surplus with japan.  reuter ;","('money-supply',)","('money-supply',)"

1571,"saudi oil minister sees no need to alter opec pact saudi arabian oil minister hisham nazer said opec's december agreement to stabilise oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there was no immediate need to change it.     nazer, in an interview with reuters and the television news agency visnews, said saudi arabia was producing around three mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its opec quota.     saudi arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will continue to restrain production as long as other opec members adhere to the pact, nazer said.     the 13-nation opec agreed in december to cut its production ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from february 1.     nazer, in his first interview since succeeding ahmed zaki yamani last october, said: ""i do not foresee any need for new measures before the 25th of june when our (next opec) meeting will take place as scheduled.""     nazer said opec was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all members were abiding by its agreements.     ""we've heard news every now and then of violations but they were not at all verified,"" he said.     opec production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a 13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last august to near 18 dlrs after announcement of the december pact.     spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in february but have firmed in the past two weeks to near opec levels as traders gained confidence in opec price and output discipline.     nazer said saudi arabia would continue to produce below its 4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price.     ""as long as all the opec members adhere to the program as devised in december, saudi arabia will continue to adhere to the agreement,"" he said.     current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the neutral zone shared with kuwait, but not sales from floating storage, nazer said.     king fahd of saudi arabia, in an interview with reuters and visnews on march 11, said the kingdom wanted oil price stability and called on non-opec producers to avoid harmful competition with opec.     ""saudi arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability,"" he said.     nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had returned to a role of ""swing producer"" within opec.     saudi arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln bpd in august 1985 to compensate for slack demand and over-production by some opec states.     ""saudi arabia is not playing that role. it is being played by opec membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8 mln bpd share of opec in the market is being shared by other members of opec,"" nazer said.     nazer said opec estimated demand for its oil during third quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd.     but he said if circumstances changed ""i am sure then the opec members will consult with each other and take the necessary measures.""     oil analysts say the opec pact could come under strain when demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern hemisphere spring and summer.     nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation from non-opec producers. norway, egypt and the soviet union agreed to help opec by restraining production or exports after he visited them on opec's behalf earlier this year.     ""we did not ask any country to do anything. these were programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing conditions,"" nazer said.     he said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate -- such as britain -- to come up with their own proposals if they saw fit.  reuter ;","('crude',)","('crude',)"

1660,"trade issues straining ec's patience with japan member states of the european community are starting to run out of patience with japan which they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.     diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by ec countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the willingness, or at least the ability, of the japanese government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the ec.     however, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as ec states know they would suffer almost as much as japan.     senior ec diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to an ec executive commission proposal under which the ec could raise tariffs on a range of japanese products if the u.s. carries out a threat to make a similar move on april 17.     the ec tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations entered into with the world trade body gatt, would be designed to stop a diversion of exports to the ec market from that of the u.s.     the diplomats were meeting as tokyo announced that the ec's trade deficit with japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in march, up from 1.94 billion in february.     in 1986, japanese exports to the ec totalled 30.67 billion dlrs, up 4.5 pct from 1985, while ec exports to japan fell one pct to 12.43 billion dlrs.     in paris, trade minister michel noir said france has decided to give japan a taste of its own medicine.     burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozen coquilles st jacques will be restricted by a strict application of french quality standards -- something ec states say often happens to their own exports entering japan.     britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of japanese banks and insurance companies to operate in the city of london, because the british cable and wireless company lost out in competition for a japanese telecommucations contract.     however, british officials in london have said that the government may have gone too far in implying that it would take immediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened.     by contrast, west germany, with the ec's most successful economy, has never threatened tokyo with sanctions, preferring to rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own industries to surmount obstacles to export to japan.     the ec commission itself has switched its tactics in recent years, substituting general calls for action by japan to open its market with specific demands for moves in key areas.     at present, it is, for instance, pressuring japan to end allegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and spirits, to ensure ec companies have a chance to win contracts for the building of a new international airport, and to simplify certification and safety checks on imported cars.     ec officials say these tactics yield some benefits, but often the japanese announce modifications of their non-tariff barriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount.     they stress, however, that any action must be taken by the ec as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action.     one of the problems britain could face if it were to withdraw licences for japanese banks would be that the bankers would be welcomed with open arms in frankfurt or amsterdam, they point out.  reuter ;","('trade',)","('trade',)"

""i am deeply concerned that when the president visits prime minister (brian) mulroney next month, he will be presented with this kind of argument, and i hope he makes it clear -- as i did when i was in canada -- that only a mutually beneficial agreement will be successful,"" bentsen said.     reagan and mulroney are scheduled to meet april 5-6 in ottawa.     bentsen urged mulroney to withdraw a proposal that would ban imports of independently produced films into canada by non-canadians, which the senator called a protectionist measure.  reuter ;","('trade',)","('trade',)"

""the field seems to be shallow and widespread, which will require a multi-platform development in recovery, pushing costs up,"" christopher osborne of stockbroker hoare govett said.     most analysts said that although the low gravity of the oil found would require additional costs in recovery, the test well showed that it flows well.

1741,"german banking authorities weigh swap regulations german banking authorities are weighing rules for banks' off-balance sheet activities in an attempt to cope with the growing volume of sophisticated capital market instruments, banking sources said.     interest rate and currency swaps and currency options are under closest scrutiny, and if revisions are made they may resemble regulation jointly proposed by the u.s. and u.k. to japan. juergen becker, director of the bundesbank's division of banking law and credit supervision, said the u.s.-british proposals were interesting, but declined to elaborate.     but banking sources said west germany was more likely to produce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals.     ""there is no formal plan yet, but talks are in the latter stages,"" one representative of the german banking association in cologne said. bankers expect rule changes this year.     all alterations must be approved by the bundesbank, west germany's four major banking associations and the federal banking supervisory office.     talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changes would require a revision of germany's credit law, which has been in effect since 1934.     authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fit present circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary political process of changing it, banking sources said.     since the beginning of 1984 the banking law has limited banks' lending to 18 times shareholders' equity plus reserves, on a consolidated basis.     but lending ratios do not extend to several newer instruments such as spot and forward currency contracts, currency and interest swaps, commercial paper programs, currency options, interest rate futures in foreign currencies and various innovative types of interest rate hedges.     the sources said the main value of the u.s.-u.k. proposals lay in differentiating between different types of risk factor, and, for instance, in placing greater weight on currency swaps than interest swaps. but even if german banking authorities agree with some of the assessments of swaps, they disagree on how to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk.     u.s.-british proposals include a complicated series of formulae for assessing the stream of payments involved in swaps, whose ultimate risk is borne by the financial intermediary, especially when counterparties remain anonymous. this is the so-called market-to-market value.     but german authorities are likely to consider this much too complex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule of lending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness of the borrowers involved, the sources said.     the weightings, also likely if lending ratios are extended to include banks' securities portfolios, are zero for public authorities, 20 pct for domestic banks, 50 pct for foreign banks and 100 pct for other foreign and non-bank borrowers.     a further complication is that the more flexible definitions of equity allowed in the u.s. and the u.k. may put german banks at a competitive disadvantage, the sources said.     stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version of the u.s.-u.k. proposals could far exceed the intent of the u.s. and british authorities, the sources said.     one specialist for dresdner bank ag said a long-dated foreign exchange forward transaction could, for instance, be brought under the same rule as a cross-currency swap, despite the fact that the risk may be entirely different.     how new regulations will affect foreign banks here was uncertain. many have converted to full subsidiary status and applied for a full banking licence over the last two years in order to lead-manage mark eurobonds.     but as their equity capital is fairly small, tight lending ratios will severely hamper foreign banks' freedom of movement, particularly in the growing business of currency swaps, if they are required to include more transactions in the balance sheet, the sources added.  reuter ;","('money-fx',)","('interest',)"

1745,"bolivia to offer to buy back bank debt bolivia is to make a formal offer during the next few months to buy back its 900 mln dlrs debt from commercial banks at a discount of up to 90 pct, central bank president jier nogales said.      nogales told reuters in an interview the steering committee of bolivia's creditor banks had agreed to consider the offer at a meeting in new york last month.      he said the offer would be based on the value of bolivian paper on the international secondary debt market, where it now trades at between 10 and 15 pct of its face value.     nogales said bolivia will make a single offer to buy back its commercial debt and banks who accepted would be paid the discounted rate in full.     banks which declined the offer would be repaid over 20 to 30 years at interest rates below those fixed in the international markets, he added.     bolivia has frozen payments on medium and long term loans to commercial banks since march, 1984, and nogales said there would be no money available to restart traditional debt servicing to them for some time.      several latin american countries have initiated schemes to cancel foreign debt by equity swaps or third party buy-backs, but bolivia would be the first country in the region to make a formal offer to buy back all its commercial bank debt at discounted rates.     nogales said practical and strategic considerations would determine the exact timing of the offer but it would be made in the next few months.      he said bolivia would not bargain with creditor banks over the price to paid for the debt paper they hold, and would make a single non-negotiable offer.     he said bolivia could not even pay interest to friendly creditor countries, let alone commercial banks. the only traditional way forward was to capitalise interest, which would mean greater bank exposure in bolivia and greater loss provisions, he added.     ""we are confident that the banks are going to be reasonable,"" nogales said. ""now they can resolve their problems for once and for all.""

1801,"ec commission defends oils and fats tax a spokesman for the european community commission defended the controversial plan for a levy on oils and fats, saying that consumers would have to help alleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax.     norbert tanghe, head of division of the commission's directorate general for agriculture, told the 8th antwerp oils and fats contact days ""the commission firmly believes that the sacrifices which would be undergone by community producers in the oils and fats sector ... would justify asking consumers to make an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem within that sector by paying a levy.""     the proposed tax is necessary because the level of budgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds production has become unacceptable, tanghe said.     recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion european currency units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0 billion ecus, he said. in 1990 the community's ""standstill"" agreements with spain and portugal end and the ec would then feel the full impact of its enlargement.     the commission has proposed several cost and production cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum guaranteed quantity system, he added.     under the commission's system for stabilising consumer prices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700 ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, tanghe said.     consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory amount when market prices are below or above this level.     he said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory amount would be used to finance the common agricultural policy's oils and fats regime.     ""the commission believes that hostile reactions (to the proposed tax) have for the most part been based on incomplete or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal,"" he said.     tanghe said the proposed system conforms with general agreement on tariffs and trade, gatt, rules.     it would not be discriminatory because it would be applied to domestic and imported products, and past experience showed it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats.     ec-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do under present aid arrangements, he said.     the competitiveness between different oils, whether ec produced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantities imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax, tanghe said.     the proposed system would not alter the ec nations' requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall effect would stabilise community production levels without affecting demand, he said.     it is one of the proposal's objectives to maintain current import levels, he said.     imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are imported primarily to satisfy the ec's cakes and meals requirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system. furthermore, more than half the oil produced from imported beans is re-exported to third countries, tanghe added.  reuter ;","('veg-oil',)","('veg-oil',)"

""the u.s. has thought carefully about what would correspond to iranian agression. they have proved to the iranians that any further action will be met with a like-for-like response. today's action by the u.s. was not escalatory,"" pyne said.     kleinwort grieveson's lambert said the u.s. strike was ""a responsible retaliation,"" with the u.s. apparently indicating to iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf iran chose to raise the level of conflict.     chase manhattan's nicol took a different view, however.     he said he was unable to see what the u.s. had achieved as arab states such as kuwait and saudi arabia, whose interests the u.s. is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a result of the u.s. attack and fear some sort of iranian retaliation.     the initial upward market move this morning reflected a strong speculative reaction to rumours of a u.s. attack which was thought at one stage to have been against iranian missile launchers on the faw peninsula, close to kuwait, analysts said.     the later downtrend followed confirmation of a u.s. navy attack on an iranian oil platform by the u.s. defence secretary caspar weinburger.     market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the gulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it less serious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower, analysts and traders said.  reuter ;","('crude',)","('crude',)"

1829,"japan expected to cut base rate for state bodies japan is expected to cut the base lending rate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 as part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in paris, finance ministry sources said.     they said the cut is based on a revision of the trust fund bureau law, which should be approved by parliament on march 3, abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with the bureau.     the bureau channels funds to government financial institutions for public works and other official uses, they said.     the base lending rate for state bodies such as the japan development bank, people's finance corp and the finance corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in tandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said.     however, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut, to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on january 28, because the trust fund bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct.     the ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the domestic economy, they said.     on tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective february 28. the move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors using the bureau, the postal savings system of the posts and telecommunications ministry and the japan welfare annuity of the ministry of health and welfare, the sources said.     these ministries are trying to determine which market rates should be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate, the ministry sources said.     coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds, minus 0.1 percentage points, is the likeliest choice, they added.  reuter ;","('interest',)","('interest',)"

1832,"u.s. corporate finance - new zealand dlr frns floating-rate notes denominated in a foreign currency, a relatively new wrinkle on wall street, will probably be issued infrequently because the so-called ""window of opportunity"" opens and closes quickly, traders say.     ""in just two days we had as many issues. as a result, the market became glutted,"" said one trader.     he said the window depends more on supply than on foreign exchange or interest rate risk, at least for the moment. ""obviously, currency risk is important. but there is a limited number of investors right now for the paper,"" he said.     on thursday, bear, stearns and co sole-managed a 100 mln new zealand dlr offering of three-year floating-rate notes issued by ford motor credit co, a unit of ford motor co <f>.     the initial rate for the notes will be set on april 15, and quarterly after that, at 200 basis points below the 90-day new zealand bank bill rate. they are non-callable for life.     this followed by a week another bear stearns-led offering of the same amount of new zealand dollar notes for dow chemical co <dow>. the initial rate was also to be initially set on april 15, and quarterly after that, at 340 basis points below the same 90-day new zealand rate.     because the dow chemical notes carried an interest rate floor of 17 pct, the issue saw strong investor demand, underwriters said.     but the ford credit notes and friday's offering of 130 mln new zealand dlrs of floating-rate notes due 1990 issued by general electric co's <ge> general electric credit corp via prudential-bache securities inc, did not have such a floor.     ""obviously, the two firms did not want to issue floaters and face the risk of new zealand rates falling sharply,"" an underwriter away from the syndicates said. he and others noted that the new zealand 90-day rate was 27 pct late last week.     an underwriter familiar with the dow chemical deal pointed out that because of the interest rate and currency swaps dow did, the issuer felt comfortable setting a rate floor.     domestic offerings of foreign currency denominated date first surfaced in fall 1985. by using currency and rate swaps, companies can sell debt that pays a high interest rate in a foreign currency like australian or new zealand dollars. but the issuers actually realize savings on borrowing costs.     ""i would say that every company which issued foreign currency debt saved some basis points when compared to same-maturity plain vanilla u.s. issues,"" an analyst said.     investors, mainly institutions, were attracted to the early issues because of the high interest rates. they were willing to absorb foreign currency risk until mid-1986, when sharp slides posted by the australian and new zealand dollars brought such issuance to a quick halt.     it was not until late last year, after the currencies stabilized, that companies again started issuing debt denominated in australian and new zealand dollars.     but many investors have still shied away from the debt, remembering the mid-1986 downturn of the australian and new zealand dollars, analysts noted.     to attract some of those investors back to the fold, underwriters like bear stearns decided to structure the foreign currency issues as floating rate debt, sources said.     this occurred against a backdrop of uncertainty over the course of u.s. interest rates for the intermediate term, and predictions by a number of economists that treasury yields would rise in the second half of the year, the sources noted.     a bear stearns officer said more than half of the ford credit notes were sold by late friday afternoon, the second day of offering. ""that is quicker than some recent fixed-rate new zealand dollar note issues,"" he said.     however, underwriters away from the bear stearns syndicate said the issue may have sold even faster if prudential-bache did not offer the general electric credit notes on friday.     they pointed out that the ford notes were rated a-1 by moody's investors and aa-minus by standard and poor's, while the general electric notes, which had the same interest rate terms and were also non-callable to maturity, carried top-flight aaa ratings by both agencies.     ""we have sold 20 to 25 pct of the ge notes. for first-day sales on a friday afternoon, i'm happy with the results,"" an officer on prudential-bache's syndicate desk said.     investors pay the u.s. dollar equivalent of the foreign currency-denominated notes, underwriters said.     investment bankers said the next floating-rate issue of new zealand or australian dollar-denominated debt is probably a few weeks away.     ""i would like to underwrite a deal a day. but with the dow, ford and ge offerings, the marketplace has had enough for the time being,"" the prudential-bache officer admitted.     meanwhile, idd information services said the 30-day corporate visible supply fell to 3.29 billion dlrs last week from 3.98 billion dlrs in the previous week.  reuter ;","('austdlr', 'nzdlr')","('acq',)"

1840,"tokyo stock plunge could force easier money policy plunging tokyo stock prices will prevent the bank of japan from raising its discount rate and could even force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues, government and private economists said.     a rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major deflationary impact on the real economy, they said.     although bank of japan officials have consistently maintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discount rate, many in the markets have thought otherwise.      fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the central bank's apparent decision last week to countenance higher rates on commercial bills, dealers said.     but today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15 pct -- means that the bank of japan would be hard pressed to raise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about a renewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said.     japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the markets concluded that the stock market's collapse precluded the central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount rate increase.     a senior government economist suggested that both the u.s. and japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a further drop in new york and tokyo stock prices. ""they need to support the stock and security markets,"" he said.     but bank of japan officials said they saw no need to change policy for the moment, although one admitted that the central bank may have to rethink its strategy if tokyo stock prices continue to plunge during the rest of the week.     both government and bank of japan economists agreed the economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago.     with the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop in stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and business confidence, one government economist said.     ""there will be some impact on the real economy, but it won't be that big,"" said another.     individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their own, although they do participate through trust funds and other investment vehicles. and while many manufacturing firms turned to financial market investments for profits during last year's economic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them to refocus their attention on their core businesses, he said.     paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that is partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have shifted funds away from financial investments to increase inventories and step up capital spending, one government economist said.     in deciding what response to make to the steep stock price drop, the bank of japan must first determine whether prices will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation, one central bank official said. ""that will at least take a couple of days, if not weeks,"" he said.  reuter ;","('interest',)","('trade',)"

1845,"investment crucial to u.s. textile recovery with more private investment, not more protection, the u.s. textile industry could become competitive with the most modern foreign producers, analysts from two congressional agencies said today.     the office of technology assessment, a nonpartisan arm of congress told a house ways and means trade subcommittee hearing there was still concern for the future of parts of the u.s. textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason for optimism than a few years ago.     ""while textile producers are making significant investments, they could do more,"" ota analyst henry kelly said.     the congressional budget office (cbo), the nonpartisan budget analysis arm of congress, said federal loans or loan guarantees would be preferable options for congress rather than increased trade protection which could lead to foreign retaliation.     cbo analyst edward gramlich said past trade protections, first imposed in the 1950's have had only a small benefit for profits and investments of domestic firms.     trade subcommittee chairman, rep. sam gibbons, said the agencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion against congressional approval of protectionist textile quota legislation aimed mainly at western europe, japan and other asian textile producing countries.     president reagan last year vetoed a textile protection bill but it was reintroduced in this session of congress and is expected to be voted on in the house this year.     however, approval this year is in doubt because passage of a major trade bill without specific protections for textiles showed a weakening of support for the legislation.     most u.s. producers have fallen behind other foreign producers in the use of modern textile and apparel production equipment and net imports are growing faster than the domestic markets, kelly said.     he added that private investment in the textile and clothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-seventh the average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct.     despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports of textiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pct while u.s. production rose only 1.9 pct.     ""the traditional industry seems destined to be replaced by new technology, imports, or some combination of both. while the industry may not be able to compete in all domestic markets that it enjoyed twenty years ago, the results of our research indicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered, and that exports can be expanded,"" kelly said.  reuter ;","('trade',)","('trade',)"

""the legislation discussed today must not be seen as an isolated measure, but as a step in an international process,"" norway's foreign minister thorvald stoltenberg told parliament.     government officials said they hope the move will intensify international pressure against the pretoria regime's apartheid policies. sweden, in a similar move last week, promised to halt all trade with south africa by october.     norway's boycott, although forbidding crude oil shipments to south africa on norwegian-owned tankers, makes an important exception for ships whose final destination is decided while they are at sea.     oil cargoes are often resold by trades after loading, making it difficult for shipowners to know their ships' final port at the start of a voyage.     critics said the bill leaves the door open for continued oil shipments to south africa. they called for stricter sanctions to stop all norwegian shipping to south africa.     norwegian tankers supplied south africa with about 30 pct of its crude imports during the early 1980s, but the trade has dropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months, trade ministry officials said.     the latest trade figures show norwegian imports from south africa dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eight months of 1986, while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crowns from the year-ago figure.     ""many would say that the law has already had its effect because of the dramatic drop in trade between south african and norway,"" foreign ministry spokesman per paust told reuters.     ""norwegian business at an early stage started restructuring its relations with south africa in anticipation of the law.     ""no one has said the boycott will have a profound effect on international trade with south africa, but it is an important political statement by the norwegian government,"" he said.     the oslo government said it will review the effects of the ban on norwegian industry after two years and may propose amendments if industry can show it is hurt by the law.     norwegian imports from south africa are limited mainly to high-grade manganese and coppernickle ores used in it ferro-alloys and light metals industries.     metals manufacturers estimate some 2,000 jobs could be affected by the boycott is suitable replacements for these ores are not found.     the legislation now goes on to the upper house for formal ratification later this week, parliamentarians said.  reuter ;","('crude', 'ship', 'trade')","('trade',)"
1851,"japan study urges foreign access to farm markets japan should increase foreign access to its farm products market, while encouraging further development of domestic agriculture, a government report said.     the white paper on agriculture for the year ended march 31 said active participation in writing world farm trade rules at the next round of general agreement on tariffs and trade (gatt) talks will help prepare japan to improve access.     agriculture ministry sources said the paper marked an easing in japan's tough position on agricultural imports which stressed the need for strict controls on some products to maintain self-sufficiency in food.     japan now produces only 30 pct of its annual grain needs, down from 61 pct some 20 years ago, official figures show.     the paper said japanese agriculture has been slow to improve productivity and demand/supply imbalances.     the relative shortage of farmland in japan is mainly responsible for higher domestic prices, it said.     the strong yen has meant lower input material prices but has also resulted in higher agricultural imports which has worsened working conditions among part-time farmers, the paper said.     this could make it difficult to improve the industry's structure, the paper said.     to solve these problems and to reduce farm product prices to more reasonable levels, japan should try to restructure the the agricultural sector to improve productivity and make it self-supporting, it said.  reuter ;","('grain',)","('trade',)"

1856,"norway extends 7.5 pct oil output cut - ministry norway will extend its 7.5 pct cutback in planned north sea oil output in support of opec from july 15 until the end of this year, oil ministry spokesman egil helle told reuters.     ""we took a very positive view of the opec meeting in vienna,"" he said. ""the accord reached there means stability in the oil market and we shall continue making our contribution.""     the cuts, originally brought in from february 1, would probably be officially approved on july 10 by parliament, helle said. the ministry had written to norway's oil companies and would now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts.     opec agreed this weekend in vienna on an output ceiling of 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and retained the fixed prices that were set in its december accord based on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point.     opec's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, and it's december pact had provisionally set a third quarter ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth quarter.     norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore fields, previously said it would continue its output curbs from planned production for the rest of the year if opec remained within its december accord on output and prices.     norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around 840,000 bpd in 1986. since then it has risen to around one mln bpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995.     the 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since february reduced norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd.     norway's oil minister arne oeien, currently in iceland for a meeting of nordic ministers, has made no official statement on the latest oil production cutbacks.     over the past year several other leading non-opec producers, including the soviet union, mexico, china, malaysia and egypt have also pledged support for opec's bid to keep prices stable.     norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an opec agreement last december which boosted oil prices to around 18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last december.     norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export earnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price during the first half of 1986.     but firmer oil prices since then have brought some stability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade deficit.      norway's north sea neighbour britain has consistently refused to cooperate with opec output cuts saying it is up to the producing oil companies to set the levels of production.  reuter ;","('crude',)","('crude',)"

1858,"japan rejects u.s. objections to fairchild sale a foreign ministry official dismissed arguments made by senior u.s. government officials seeking to block the sale of a u.s. microchip maker to a japanese firm.     ""they appear to be linking completely unrelated issues,"" shuichi takemoto of the foreign ministry's north american division told reuters.     u.s. commerce secretary malcolm baldrige has asked the white house to consider blocking the sale of <fairchild semiconductor corp> to japan's fujitsu ltd <itsu.t>, u.s. officials said yesterday.     baldrige expressed concern that the sale would leave the u.s. military dependent on a foreign company for vital high technology equipment. pentagon officials said defence secretary caspar weinberger also opposes to the sale.     u.s. officials have also said the sale would give fujitsu a powerful role in the u.s. market for supercomputers while japan's supercomputer market remains closed to u.s. sales.     takemoto said national security should not be an issue since the planned purchase of fairchild from its current owner, schlumberger ltd <slb>, does not include fairchild's main defence-related division.     in addition, takemoto said tension over the supercomputer trade should not affect the sale as fairchild does not make supercomputers.     analysts noted that fairchild does make sophisticated microchips used in supercomputers. fujitsu makes similar chips and supplies them to u.s. supercomputer makers, they said.     takemoto also dismissed u.s. fears that the proposed takeover would violate u.s. antitrust law, saying ""the purchase would not result in fujitsu monopolising the u.s. semiconductor market.""     two separate issues appear to have come together to boost pressure to block the purchase, industry analysts said.     the move is in part an attempt to force japan to open its domestic market to more u.s. supercomputer sales, they said.     u.s. officials have repeatedly charged that the japanese public sector is closed to u.s. supercomputer sales despite u.s. firms' technological lead in the field.     ""the united states believes japan will only react when bullied, and this is a bullying ploy,"" salomon brothers asia analyst carole ryavec said.     however, the analysts said more is at stake than supercomputer sales as the u.s. fears it is losing its vital semiconductor industry to japanese competitors.     ""the real issue is xenophobia in (the u.s.) silicon valley,"" said tom murtha of brokerage james capel and co.     u.s.-japanese tension over the semiconductor trade has failed to subside despite recent efforts by japan's ministry of international trade and industry (miti) to get japanese firms to abide by a bilateral pact aimed at halting predatory pricing and opening japan's market.     a miti official said that while japan is faithfully abiding by the agreement, problems remain in halting the sale of microchips in europe and southeast asia at prices below those set by the pact.     ""it is only a matter of time before we solve this problem,"" he told reuters.     despite the furore, fujitsu will proceed with talks on the acquisition in line with the basic agreement reached with schlumberger last year, a fujitsu spokeswoman told reuters.  reuter ;","('acq',)","('trade',)"

1886,"bank sees modest recovery in gulf arab economies the emirates industrial bank has predicted a modest economic recovery in the gulf arab states following higher oil revenues.     a bank study, carried by the emirates news agency wam, said total oil revenues of the six gulf cooperation council (gcc) countries were likely to reach 39 billion dlrs this year from 33.5 billion in 1986.     the gcc groups bahrain, kuwait, oman, qatar, saudi arabia and the united arab emirates (uae).     the bank said the improvement would result from higher oil prices made possible by last december's opec accord to restrain overall group production.     these curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eight dollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs.     ""all signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery in the economies of these (gcc) countries, although this expected growth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years,"" the study said.     it added, however, that gcc states would experience higher budget deficits this year because of needs arising from past recession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts.     the study said the combined gcc bugdet deficits would rise to 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year.     it said lower oil exports cut the gcc states' combined trade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in 1985.     the uae suffered a 19.5 pct drop in gross domestic product to 77.6 billion dirhams last year from 96.4 billion in 1985, it added.  reuter ;","('crude',)","('crude',)"

""the same policy that has been followed will be continued,"" said the official, who asked not to be further identified.     a spokesman for the central bank said the bank had no information on any silver policy changes.     an energy and mines ministry spokesman and an official in the ministry's metallurgy department also said no government silver policy change had been made.     the mining sector official also said he doubted mexico would follow peru's policy, reasoning that if the two governments had intended to coordinate silver policies, mexico would have announced a sales suspension along with peru last week.

1891,"japan has little new to offer in microchip dispute the japanese government appears to have little new to offer to settle a dispute with the u.s. over computer chips, trade analysts and government officials said.     the u.s. has threatened to impose tariffs worth up to 300 mln dlrs on japanese electronics exports to the u.s., in retaliation for japan's alleged failure to keep a pact on the microchip trade signed last september.     a foreign ministry official told reuters ""japan has done what it can, and now we must persuade the united states to wait for those steps to take effect.""     the u.s. alleges that, in defiance of the september agreement, japan is still selling microchips at below cost in non-u.s. markets and refusing to open japan further to u.s. chip sales. u.s. tariffs are due to take effect on april 17.      analysts noted japan's ministry of international trade and industry (miti) has already ordered chipmakers to cut production in order to dry up the source of cheap chips sold in third countries at non-regulated prices.     ""i'm not sure miti can do much more than it has,"" said jardine fleming (securities) ltd analyst nick edwards.     a miti official said the ministry was not planning to call for production cuts beyond those already sought, although it would continue to press chip users to buy more foreign goods.     spokesmen for some japanese electronics firms said they would consider buying more u.s. chips. but a matsushita electric industrial co spokesman said a rapid increase in imports was not likely.     most analysts said japanese exporters would be hard hit if the united states did implement the tariffs, which would be levied on consumer electronics products rather than on microchips themselves.     ""if the tariffs remain in place for any length of time, there will be complete erosion of exports to the united states,"" said tom murtha, analyst at james capel and co.     ""the japanese electronics industry is too powerful to be stopped altogether, but recovery for the industry will be delayed for another year,"" he said.     some analysts said tariffs would also harm u.s. industry by stepping up offshore production and by reducing demand in japan for semiconductors u.s. firms are trying to sell here.     ""the american approach is full of contradictions,"" jardine fleming's edwards said.     ""if they want to expand (u.s.) exports, the last thing they want to do is hit the makers of the final products because that hurts the final market,"" edwards said.     but other analysts said the dispute reflects not just u.s. concern over what it sees as a strategic industry, but also frustration with japan's vast trade surplus. some analysts argued that to solve the semiconductor problem japan may have to take action beyond that pledged in the semiconductor pact.     carole ryavec, an analyst at salomon brothers asia ltd, said ""the major overall issue is to stimulate the domestic economy and move away from an export-dependent economy.""  reuter ;","('trade',)","('trade',)"

""all of the g-7 nations believe that any further decline in the dollar would be counterproductive,"" baker told reporters.     following the venice press conference by reagan, the white house clarified reagan's comments on the dollar by saying that the united states wants a stable dollar.     the main incentive for the united states to favor a weaker dollar has been the need to reduce the massive trade deficit, but the deficit has narrowed for the past two months and appears to be responding to the 40 pct drop in the dollar against the yen and the mark during the past two years.  reuter ;","('dlr', 'money-fx')","('trade',)"

""it looks good,"" diaz said. but he added several issues, including the identity of the ultimate buyers of the shares, had to be resolved before the pcgg gave its approval to the sale.     the pcgg's sequestration last year of 33 mln shares aborted smc's bid to buy them back from 14 trading companies in the ucpb group. the commission said it suspected the shares were actually controlled by eduardo cojuangco, an associate of former president ferdinand marcos.     cojuango, who headed the boards of both smc and ucpb when he fled last year after marcos was toppled, personally owned 24 mln shares in smc. his holdings are also under sequestration.     ""the shares that smc now proposes to buy from the ucpb are owned by 1.4 mln coconut farmers,"" diaz said. ""naturally we do not want them to go back into the hands of marcos cronies.""     pcgg sources said a compromise would end a row over a down payment of 500 mln pesos made by smc's hong kong subsidiary neptunia corp ltd in a bid to buy back the shares last year.     the ucpb had said the 500 mln peso payment would be forfeited because smc chairman andres soriano iii had failed to fulfil his commitment to buy back the shares at an originally negotiated price of 3.3 billion pesos.     pcgg sources said smc, the philippines' largest food and beverage manufacturer, has agreed to sell 14 mln ""b"" class shares from the 38.1 mln shares to australian brewer alan bond at a price of 150 pesos per share.     the pcgg sources said of the proposed 4.79 billion peso transaction, 1.6 billion pesos would be offset against the 500 mln peso down payment, the 500 mln pesos worth of preferred shares in ucpb held by smc, 210 mln pesos in uncollected dividends on the ucpb shares and 400 mln pesos advanced to ucpb-controlled trading companies.     the ucpb rejected an original offer of 100 pesos per share made by smc for 33 mln shares, which grew to 38 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend declared in june last year.     a spokesman for smc said the company's 15-member board met today to discuss the proposed compromise.     the spokesman declined comment on the outcome of the board meeting, saying the dispute was under arbitration.     president corazon aquino last month asked smc and ucpb to set up a three-man arbitration panel to resolve the ownership issue. the panel is due to submit its report by april 15.     eduardo de los angeles, a government nominee in the smc board, filed a formal complaint before the securities and exchange commission last week, accusing soriano and eight other directors of violating ""fiduciary duty.""     de los angeles was said to have opposed a decision by smc's board last december to assume the 500 mln peso neptunia loan.  reuter ;","('acq',)","('acq',)"

""we have to keep wages as low as possible,"" he said.     he also said the yen's large and rapid rise is depressing the outlook for the japanese economy, noting that in addition to hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic market manufacturers through cheap imports.     parts of the service sector are also threatened, otsuki said.     tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and a downturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect service industries, he said.     it is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fully employ those put out of work in the manufacturing sector, he said.     profits of service sector companies are likely to fall in the business year ending in march 1988, leading to a possible recession in the japanese economy, he said.     otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyond levels experienced in 1986.     the government's economic planning agency said last week the economy grew at 2.5 pct in 1986, the worst performance since 1974 when the economy shrank 1.4 pct due to the first oil price crisis.     in order to stimulate domestic demand and boost the economy, tax reforms aimed at bringing down the cost of land and reforming the nation's housing stock are needed, along with steps to bring down the high cost of commodities, he said.  reuter ;","('money-fx', 'yen')","('trade',)"
1910,"s.korea says japan complains to gatt on trade plan japan has complained to the secretariat of the general agreement on tariffs and trade (gatt) that south korea's five-year plan to cut its trade deficit with japan breaks gatt rules, trade ministry officials here said.     they said japan submitted a report earlier this month alleging south korea's plan to import less from japan and more from the u.s. and elsewhere was tantamount to creating non-tariff trade barriers.     south korea unveiled the plan in november. it said it hoped to narrow its trade deficit with japan to two billion dlrs by 1991.     south korea's trade deficit with japan was a record 5.45 billion dlrs in 1986, and rose to 752 mln dlrs in the first two months of 1987 from 727 mln in the same 1986 period.     the plan envisages giving incentives to importers not to import japanese goods, and to exporters to sell more to japan.     the officials said they believed the japanese action, one step short of filing a suit, was designed to bring south korea to the negotiating table and stop the plan.     the seoul government wants tokyo to ease various import restrictions and simplify customs inspections for south korean goods to help reduce the trade deficit.  reuter ;","('trade',)","('trade',)"

""greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts,"" he said.     the gib study reviewed capital markets under three categories -- money markets, stock and bond markets.     azzam said gulf states had been making greater use of short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities.     ""nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a large extent, fragmented and lagging behind,"" he said.     most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues. only kuwait has an official stock exchange, while other gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges.     but with dwindling financial surpluses in the gulf, governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges, azzam said.     he said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had ""clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region.""     in addition, family firms are reluctant to go public, financial awareness among investors is still lacking and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth. a sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery.     azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some gulf countries and authorities' apparent reluctance to adopt financial innovations had also hampered capital markets.     he called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments.     azzam said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of gulf cooperation council (gcc) states -- bahrain, kuwait, qatar, oman, saudi arabia and the united arab emirates (uae). some moves had been taken in this direction, with bahrain allowing gcc nationals to own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies.     azzam said gulf money markets had received greater depth from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in bahrain and the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in saudi arabia.     but he added there is ""no bond market to speak of"" in saudi arabia, qatar, oman or the uae, with the last saudi riyal denominated bond issued in 1978.     while bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading in saudi arabia has picked up, establishment of formal exchanges in qatar, oman and the uae does not appear imminent, azzam said.  reuter ;","('money-fx',)","('crude',)"
1966,"economic spotlight - ems marks eighth birthday the european monetary system marks its eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in europe, economists say. but many economists say the system, which holds eight european community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands, remains in its infancy.     its new currency, the european currency unit (ecu), has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar.     and on wednesday, the long term vision of the ecu as europe's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when belgium minted the world's first ecu coin.     but economists say members such as west germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system's founding fathers, ex-west german chancellor helmut schmidt and former french president valery giscard d'estaing.     under this phase, originally due to have started two years after the ems was set up, decision-making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous european monetary fund.     but members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters. ""the basic problem of the ems is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common,"" said one economist who has closely watched the system's development.     the result is that the ec is often divided over policy on third currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the system's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar.     over the past 18 months, as the u.s. dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp rise of the west german mark severely strained the system.     another frustration has been britain's failure to lend the ems political support by keeping the pound, still a major world currency, outside the system.     no change in the british government's attitude is expected before the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988.     meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since it was set up, prompted european finance ministers to ask the ec's highly-secretive monetary committee and committee of central bank governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it.     their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in belgium early next month.     but economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details. they are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change.     ""technical measures won't be enough to protect the ems against external factors such as dollar weakness. for that we must take the step forward to the institutional level,"" said leo de corel of kredietbank's economic research department.     economists say the system's fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. if the dollar resumes its slide the ems could be in for more turbulence, they predict.  reuter ;","('money-fx',)","('money-fx',)"

""you're talking about a 50 pct increase in crude oil prices, but i think that time is coming and we've got to be prepared,"" mcmillan said.     he predicted u.s. oil demand would rise by about one pct annually in the next few years while the nation fails to replace its oil reserves through exploration. by the turn of the century, world oil prices will be significantly higher because of declining supplies, mcmillan said.     ashland oil, inc. chairman john hall, who also spoke at the meeting, advocated some form of federal tax incentives to help spur development of synthetic fuels.     the united states, hall said, has nearly 500 billion tons of demonstrated coal reserves, an amount more than triple that of all the world's known oil reserves.     ""we must encourage research now in order to make synfuels competitive later,"" hall said. the average lead time for development of a shale oil or liquified coal project is between five and ten years.     until last year, the federal government had subsidized synfuels development through the u.s. synthetic fuels corp., a research program created during the carter administration with the goal of developing replacements for up to two mln barrels of oil.     the corporation was shut down last april when congress refused to continue funding its eight billion dlr budget because of uneconomic projects based on forecasts of 50 dlrs a barrel oil and 10 dlr per mcf natural gas during this decade.  reuter ;","('crude',)","('crude',)"

1982,"swiss prepared to increase currency intervention the swiss national bank is prepared to increase its intervention on currency markets if the action can be properly coordinated with other central banks, markus lusser, a member of the bank's three man directorate, said.     he told a meeting of swiss industrialists that intervention to support the dollar could not bring about lasting changes in exchange rates unless accompanied by fundamental changes in economic policy.     however, intervention could send signals that would contribute to a short term smoothing of currency movements.     the national bank was prepared to intensify cooperation with other central banks, especially where convincing coordination and significant timing are guaranteed, lusser said.     he said currency developments could not simply be talked into existence but needed to be matched by actions in the field of economic policy.     ""put simply, that means that in order to stabilise the dollar in a lasting way, a reduction of the budget deficit and a slowdown in money supply growth in the united states are unavoidable,"" he said.     the national bank has intervened in dollar-yen repeatedly in the last few weeks and earlier this week it said it had intervened in dollar-swiss franc for the first time since last october.     lusser said the key to increased exchange rate stability lay not in currency intervention by central banks but only in an improvement in international economic policy coordination.     this meant that industrial countries must avoid abrupt switches in economic policy and give priority to price stability.     lusser said the national bank continued to take the view that easing its strict monetary policies would be incompatible with its primary goal of combatting inflation. the bank target is for growth of two pct in central bank money supply in 1987.     he noted that in 1978, when the swiss franc rose sharply against all currencies, the bank was forced to abandon its money supply targets in favour of an exchange rate target, with the result that inflation surged.     ""current exchange rate developments have not, until today at any rate, made any such measures by the national bank necessary,"" he said.  reuter ;","('money-fx', 'money-supply', 'sfr')","('money-fx',)"
1983,"u.s. banks likely to lift prime rates again soon major u.s. banks may lift prime lending rates again within days due to recent increases in their borrowing costs and speculation the federal reserve is nudging up interest rates to help the dollar, economists said.     in what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, most banks in early april lifted their rates a quarter point to 7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own cost of money. that spread has narrowed again.     ""a prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,"" said robert brusca of nikko securities co international inc.     brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is justified because the spread between banks' cost of funds and the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a percentage point.     he said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentage points since last october until it fell below one point and triggered the april prime rate rise at most banks.     ""we could easily have another prime rate increase as soon as this week,"" said david jones of aubrey g. lanston and co.     ""we've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the near future,"" said allan leslie of discount corp.     ""based on the spread between the prime rate and funding costs, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,"" said harold nathan, economist at wells fargo bank.     however, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan demand and because some are not sure the fed will maintain recent upward pressure on money market interest rates.     nathan believes the fed has let market pressures lift short-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. he said ""if there is widespread belief money market rates will stay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time.""     fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a dollar drop could help rekindle u.s. inflation. as the dollar fell to a 40-year low against the yen friday, currency traders said the fed and other central banks supported the dollar.     in addition to buying dollars outright, another way to stabilize the u.s. currency would be for the fed to push u.s. interest rates higher relative to overseas rates.     based particularly on the fed's reserve management actions on friday and today, nathan of wells fargo said ""it has become clear that the fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure in the market. it is supplying fewer reserves than are needed.""     bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest rates rose sharply friday and today on heightened speculation that the fed is gently firming monetary policy.     that was because the fed supplied far fewer reserves in the market than most economists had expected.     on friday, the fed added reserves indirectly and in small amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements with the federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another high at 6-5/16 pct. with funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct today, the fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr round of customer repurchase agreements.     ""the fed's actions on friday and today show that it is offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,"" said jones of lanston.     ""the fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the need to defend the dollar,"" jones said. he believes it is merely shading policy toward restraint now, ""but to have a major impact on the dollar, the fed will have to tighten policy overtly at some point.""     jones expects the fed to foster higher market rates by becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, within four to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct.     jones said a u.s. discount rate increase to six pct might well be accompanied by west german and japanese rate cuts to further aid the dollar.     given likely fed policy firming, he said both the yield on 30-year treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime rate may be at 8-1/2 pct at end-june and nine pct by year's end.     ""the jury is still out on whether the fed is tightening policy to defend the dollar,"" said leslie of discount corp. he said tax-date pressures have been pushing up fed funds lately. leslie said fed actions and reserve data once these pressures abate will show whether or not it is firming policy.    reuter ;","('interest', 'money-fx')","('interest',)"
1984,"german banks say uncertainty about economy growing uncertainty is growing about the prospects for the economy as orders for industry fall and companies scale back investment plans, the german savings banks and giro association said.     exporters expect foreign demand to remain weak, while industry is less optimistic than it was, the association said in a report.     however, last month's agreement among the six leading western industrialized countries to keep currencies around present levels was expected to be a stabilizing influence for exporters, it added.     the banking association said the possibility of using monetary policy to stimulate the economy should not be overestimated.     another small drop in already low interest rates could not be expected to cause any significant rise in purchases of consumer or capital goods, it said.     the bundesbank's half-point cuts in the discount and lombard rates in january have largely exhausted the scope for any further monetary moves, the association added.     on tuesday the federal statistics office said gross national product stagnated in real, seasonally and calendar adjusted terms in the fourth quarter of 1986 compared with the third quarter.     the economics ministry, commenting on the figures, said gnp in the 1987 first quarter was also expected to be relatively weak.     bank economists have forecast the economy will either stagnate or contract slightly in the first quarter. official first-quarter figures are due in early june.  reuter ;","('gnp',)","('interest',)"

1998,"joint action said vital to boost world growth prospects for world economic growth remain very sluggish, and coordinated action by western governments is urgently needed to restore business confidence, stabilize currencies and encourage investment, the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) said here.     ""the economic situation has deteriorated in recent months, and ... slow growth, high unemployment and large payments imbalances are likely to persist,"" it said in one of its gloomiest reviews of the world economy in recent years.     the gross national product (gnp) of the 24-nation bloc of western industrialised countries is forecast to grow by only 2.25 pct both this year and next, even slower than last year's 2.5 pct growth rate.     ""we would like to see the aggregate for the oecd area comfortably exceeding three pct,"" david henderson, head of the oecd's economics and statistics department, said.     the oecd said that the dollar fall had led to rising inflation expectations and higher interest rates in the u.s., combining with world trade imbalances and the huge third world debt problem to increase the risks of a world economic downturn.     ""at the same time, many of the conditions for faster growth remain favorable,"" it said, citing low inflation in most major countries, healthy corporate finances, generally lower interest rates, improvements in state budget positions and more flexible labor markets.     but private sector confidence had been undermined by uncertainties over exchange rates, it said, and warned that ""for confidence to be restored, it is important for governments swiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments.""     this was a clear reference to last february's louvre accord of the group of five nations plus canada, analysts said.     the oecd said that apparent disagreements among major countries on implementation of the louvre accord had helped to undermine business confidence, and called on more active fiscal policies from the u.s., west germany and japan to slow demand in the u.s. and raise it in the other two countries.     henderson said the 6,000 billion yen package announced recently by the japanese government to encourage public works and cut taxes would make a significant contribution to this process, though it was too early to estimate its precise impact.     he said the measures will help strengthen japan's domestic demand significantly, quite possibly exceeding one pct of gnp.     the inflation outlook, while broadly satisfactory, has worsened in recent months, with oecd consumer prices forecast to rise 3.5 pct this year and 3.75 pct in 1988 after a 2.8 pct increase in 1986.     there is no prospect for any significant improvement in the unemployment situation over the next 18 months, with the average rate expected to stabilize at 8.25 pct, similar to last year.     the oecd called for efforts to liberalize world agricultural markets through switching farm subsidies away from price guarantees and other measures linked to production towards direct income support for farmers.  reuter ;","('cpi', 'gnp', 'jobs')","('trade',)"

""the talk is about conoco, which is controlled by dupont <dd>, and atlantic richfield co <arc>, which sold its canadian interest in 1975 and could be getting back in,"" said wilf gobert of peters and co ltd.     david bryson of moss lawson and co also noted that british petroleum plc <bp> is mentioned as a possible buyer, despite bp's 70 u.s. dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the 45 percent of standard oil co <srd> it does not already own.     calgary-based independent analyst james hamilton has said in recent reports that amoco corp <an> has also been in talks with dome.     representatives of atlantic richfield, british petroleum, conoco and amoco were not immediately available for comment.     gobert characterized the market action in dome today as ""awfully optimistic,"" given transcanada's offer to give current dome shareholders stock in a new subsidiary, which it valued at 1.10 dlrs canadian per common share.     under the offer, current dome common and preferred shareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, which would own and operate all dome's former assets. transcanada would own 80 pct.     however, bryson said the market may be looking at the potential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. ""the transcanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for dome,"" he said.     gobert said he believes the transcanada offer is ""at the upper end of what i thought somebody would pay for dome.""     the transcanada proposal would pay dome's creditors 3.87 billion canadian dlrs (2.90 billion u.s. dlrs), with another one billion canadian dlrs (750 mln u.s. dlrs) available to secured creditors if the dome subsidiary earns profits above a certain level. transcanada would not detail the profit level.     dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billion canadian dlrs (4.5 billion u.s. dlrs) in debt, which it took on several years ago when oil prices were high and the company wanted to expand.     ""there has been speculation that dome's assets are capable of supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on that basis, the transcanada offer would be at the upper end of that,"" gobert said.     dome's debt troubles have often obscured the fact that it is a major player in the canadian oil and gas field. it holds reserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billion cubic feet of natural gas.     the company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acres of oil and gas exploration land in the province of alberta, the heart of canada's oil industry.    dome owns or has an interest in a total of 36.1 mln acres of land across canada.    the company also has tax credits of about 2.5 billion dlrs canadian (1.9 billion dlrs u.s.). it reported a 1986 loss of 2.2 billion dlrs (1.65 billion dlrs u.s.), believed to be the largest ever by a canadian company.      reuter ;","('acq',)","('acq',)"

2006,"italy sets rules for company holdings in banks companies will henceforth be able to own stakes in banks, but these should not constitute a ""dominant"" holding, an italian government committee ruled.     the interministerial committee on credit and savings, headed by treasury minister giovanni goria, said its decision reflected the ""need to safeguard the principle of separation between banks and non-financial concerns.""     it did not quantify what might constitute a ""dominant"" holding.     the committee also set conditions for the allocation of credits by banks to companies or individuals holding stakes in them, and stipulates conditions under which the bank of italy could exercise its powers of control in the case of stakes held by banks in companies or other banks.     under the ruling, credits given by banks or their subsidiaries to groups or individuals holding five pct or more of the bank's capital must not exceed defined limits.     the value of credits given cannot exceed either one-fifth of the combined capital and reserves of the bank itself or two-fifths of the value of the stake owned in the bank by the group or individual concerned.     exceptions to these conditions include credits to concerns in which the bank itself has a stake and to branches of foreign banks. credits made by foreign companies or banks to subsidiaries which have their legal base in italy will also be excluded from the conditions.     the bank of italy will request banks to insert rules in their statutes to ensure that companies or individuals holding five pct or more of the bank's capital are not given privileged treatment with regard to credit allocation and terms.     with regard to bank holdings in companies, the bank of italy can exercise supervisory controls when information on a bank's consolidated activities show single shareholdings in a company or another bank of 25 pct or more, owned directly or indirectly.     such controls can also be exercised even if the stake held is below 25 pct if it can be considered a controlling interest.     the controls will not be exercised in cases where the value of the bank's stake in a concern is below the lesser of two predefined limits.     these limits are set at 15 billion lire or two pct of the total assets of the parent company of the shareholding bank.  reuter ;","('acq',)","('acq',)"

2010,"fiji makes sugar payment to get harvest started fiji sugar farmers will receive an interim payment on the 1986 crop, four months ahead of schedule, in a move aimed at getting harvesting of the drought-hit 1987 crop under way, governor-general ratu sir penaia ganilau said.     industry sources said latest forecasts for the 1987 crop indicated output of 360,000 tonnes, well down on the record 501,800 tonne tel quel production in the 1986 (may-december) crop year.     the previous record was set in 1982 when fiji produced 486,790 tonnes.     for the past month fiji sugar farmers have delayed harvesting the 1987 crop pending a response from the governor-general to demands following the may 14 coup.     ganilau said in a statement the fiji sugar corp would make a payment of five dlrs per tonne against the final payment for the 1986 crop on the understanding that preparations by growers for commencement of harvesting would be completed at all mills by june 23.     crushing would commence at labasa and penang mills on june 23 and at lautoka and rarawai mills on june 30, he said.     the interim payment, to be made on or about june 30, is the full amount of the grower's share of 1986 sugar proceeds received to-date. the balance will be paid in october.     growers had also called for the full 1987 forecast price of 23.50 dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery to the mill, but this has been rejected by the state controlled fiji sugar corp, ganilau said.     however, in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of 14.10 dlrs, an additional sum of 2.35 dlrs, or 10 pct of the forecast price, would be paid on december 15, on all cane harvested by november 30, he said.     ganilau said, ""this will be at least one month in advance of the expected date of payment of the second payment of cane. the balance of the second payment will be made six weeks after the end of crushing.""     another demand of fiji's 22,000 small farmers was that an estimated 14 mln dlr loan from the fiji development bank (fdb) for the 1983 cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off. the fdb rejected this request.     ganilau said, however, ""the bank is prepared to carefully consider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases of hardship on a case-by-case basis.""     in response to a further demand that all soldiers be removed from the cane growing areas, ganilau said the army would restrict its presence in the cane areas.     he said he had directed the authorities to issue permits to harvesting gangs, cane growers and sugar industry trade unions to hold the necessary meetings in preparation for the commencement of harvest.     senior representatives of the sugar cane growers had indicated a desire to commence the crush as soon as possible, he added.  reuter ;","('sugar',)","('sugar',)"

2017,"japan ministry says dollar should be above 170 yen the dollar should worth more than 170 yen based on purchasing power parity, the ministry of international trade and industry (miti) said in its annual white paper on international trade.     using 1973 as a base year, the ministry said inflation differentials pointed to a yen/dollar rate of 172 in fourth quarter 1986. the dollar opened here today at 144.90 yen.     miti also said the so-called ""j-curve"" and the drop in oil prices together accounted for 33.2 billion dlrs of the 36.6 billion dlr rise in japan's trade surplus last year.     on a customs cleared basis, the japanese trade surplus rose to a record 82.66 billion dlrs last year.     the ministry said the fall in oil prices accounted for 16.5 billion dlrs and the ""j-curve"" 17.2 billion dlrs of the rise in the 1986 surplus.     analyzing the expansion in japan's trade imbalance in recent years, miti calculated that 37 pct of it could be accounted for by exchange rates, 24 pct by differences in economic growth rates between japan and other countries, and 36 pct by so-called price elasticities of imports and exports.     analyzing the expansion in the u.s. trade deficit from 1982 to 1985, the ministry said 24 pct was accounted for by exchange rates, 34 pct by differences in the income elasticity of imports and exports and 39 pct by differences in economic growth rates. the figures do not tally to 100 pct because other minor factors have been left out.     ""one index of trade structure, the income elasticity of exports and imports, shows that the u.s. is more likely to experience increases in imports, while japan is structurally predisposed to growth in exports,"" miti said.     structural adjustment is already underway in japan, under the impact of the strong yen, miti said. japanese companies are stepping up their imports and expanding capacity overseas.     japanese consumer attitudes are also changing. the ministry cited a survey showing that price was now the number one factor in the purchase of imports from the u.s. and western europe, replacing design and brand reputations.     ""the smooth adjustment of the economic structure calls for measures to address the needs of affected firms,"" it said. ""whole industries have felt the pinch and employment is expected to suffer.""     ""sustained economic growth, led by domestic demand, will also be an essential condition,"" the ministry said.     it said four structural factors have contributed to the growth of the u.s. trade deficit in recent years -- a decline in u.s. industrial competitiveness, insufficient productive capacity, an increase in foreign procurement by u.s. companies and short-sighted u.s. management attitudes.     ""while (u.s.) exports have picked up somewhat with the dollar's fall in value, no marked improvements have appeared in the import picture,"" miti said.  reuter ;","('dlr', 'money-fx', 'trade')","('trade',)"
2018,"heineken sees higher profits, wider penetration dutch brewer heineken nv said it hoped to maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to the 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite continuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts to extend world penetration.     heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln guilders, after 265 mln in 1985.     chairman freddie heineken said the company, europe's leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986, said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.     the volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the u.s., where the brand amstel lite saw great demand, and in europe, where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.     turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker foreign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.     further consolidation of foreign companies, including the increase of its stake in leading spanish brewery <el aguila s.a.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly in french and spanish interests, eroded profit margins. the company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in restructuring and marketing, heineken said.     heineken's spanish activities should start yielding profit next year, heineken said, adding that its french operations had already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.     vice chairman gerard van schaik said the decision by the european court of justice in luxembourg to allow foreign beer into the closed west german market -- europe's biggest beer market -- offered interesting possibilities for heineken. ""we have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important point,"" van schaik said, adding that since the ruling heineken had been inundated by german traders seeking joint ventures.     ""the question is not if we want to penetrate the german market, but how we are to do it,"" van schaik said, adding that while the widely traveled germans seemed to be developing a taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very regionalized.      heineken board member hans coebergh, responsible for african operations, said he saw africa as one of the most important beer growth markets in the long term.      he said the company, present in africa since 1932 and with majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was hampered by the lack of hard currencies there.     africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total 1986 sales.     on-site production is rendered expensive by the high price of imports of essential ingredients. but heineken scientists have been looking at other possibilities.     to balance the costs of imported malt, heinken launched on the nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which had sold successfully, coebergh said.     heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw materials, but coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were popular in rwanda . ""this is a possibility, but we could not possibly achieve the heineken flavor,"" coebergh said.     chairman heineken said the company's seven year efforts to penetrate the soviet market had finally resulted this week in a contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.     but again, a lack of hard currencies limited heineken's market potential. heineken now has seven bars in moscow that are enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western money.  reuter ;","('earn',)","('trade',)"
2019,"southern europe has strong domestic demand growth strong growth in domestic demand was a key feature of the economies of southern european countries in 1986, though the growth is seen slowing this year and next, the organisation for economic cooperation and development said.     in its semi-annual report, the oecd said portugal's total domestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year to five pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growth restrained private consumption.     turkey's economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 and domestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expected to be halved to five pct next year.     in spain, buoyant domestic demand, led by fixed investment, had been the driving force behind rapid growth in gross domestic product. both fixed investment and private consumption were expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain strong.     the oecd forecast that spanish imports would rise sharply next year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the european community and declining competitiveness.     in greece, inflation was forecast to turn downwards following an increase early this year linked with the introduction of value added tax and a surge in food prices due to cold weather.  reuter ;","('gnp',)","('gnp',)"

2031,"aluminium capacity growth trend seen insufficient aluminium capacity expansion planned for the period after 1990 will be insufficient to supply any acceleration in demand growth, let alone an increase on the scale which seems likely, according to analyst anthony bird associates' 1987 aluminium review.     by 1995 non-socialist world primary capacity will need to be around 18 mln tonnes, whereas on current plans only 15 mln tonnes are scheduled, bird said.     bird forecast higher economic growth after 1990 and increased imports by less developed countries.     aluminium consumption growth is not expected to accelerate by as much as general growth, but non-socialist world consumption is nevertheless forecast to increase sharply from 13.77 mln tonnes in 1990 to 17.25 mln tonnes in 1995, bird said.     aluminium companies were slow to adjust to the pace of change after 1973, the review said, and now they have completed this transition they may be in danger of remaining preoccupied with the strategies of retrenchment and survival which have served them well in recent years.     in order to encourage the construction of additional smelters aluminium prices will need to settle at a higher level.     production costs are likely to rise again in the years ahead as the glut of alumina capacity vanishes and electricity suppliers take a more aggressive line with aluminium companies, according to the review.     at march 1987 prices the three most likely cost-price scenarios call for a long-run aluminium price of between 73 and 89.5 cents a lb, depending on exchange rates, bird said.     such a price development is not expected to cause any marked competitive problems for the metal because of the likely rise in commodity prices as a whole and cost pressures in the pipeline for steel and copper.     in the short term, however, the outlook is dull, bird said, as the world economy has not responded well to the opportunities offered by cheap oil.     its 1987 consumption forecast of 13.01 mln tonnes is 0.4 pct down on 1986, while production is forecast six pct higher in 1987 at 12.67 mln tonnes.  reuter ;","('alum',)","('alum',)"

""but at the end of the day, the attitude is going to be ""leave well alone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered.""     iran, libya and saudi arabia are among those who also saw sales problems earlier this year, traders say. but diminished customer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases, marketing incentives have helped their sales.     some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by means of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside better priced grades in a ""package.""     many opec crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least for some part of the year. but many experts say opec should change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. at its last meeting in december, opec agreed to reintroduce fixed prices from february 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference point. official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985 when members offered discounts to attract customers.     opec also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8 mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter and 18.3 mln for the fourth. analysts expect it will now extend or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.     spot market and netback values for some crudes do not mirror official prices, but opec will probably keep the 18 dlr target and at most make minimal changes to differentials, analysts say.     the 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six opec and one non-opec crudes. opec assigned prices to its other key export crudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest. extra heavy crudes were among those left out.     industry estimates vary on the proportion of opec oil exports actually sold at official prices. several experts say only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at official prices, with some of the rest included in processing or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.     problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year, when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to pay the new prices.    nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich bonny light crude -- now opec's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel -- was uncompetitive on the spot market against britain's brent.     in february and march, nigeria's production shrank below its 1.238 mln bpd opec quota. spot prices have since revived, due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has risen.     some experts feel bonny light is still overvalued and say its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.     but mehdi varzi, chief oil analyst with london's kleinwort grieveson securities, doubts nigeria will actively push the differentials question in vienna.     ""it would not look good for opec unity if nigeria, which holds the presidency, raised the issue,"" he said.  reuter ;","('crude',)","('crude',)"

""we are sitting on a barrel of powder, but fortunately it may still be wet,"" he added.     liquidity among private households and especially the corporate sector has increased substantially, he said.     the liquidity is the reason for the recent boom of stock exchange prices, the bank official said. this inflow of funds into the stock exchange, occurring also in other countries, may continue, he said.  reuter ;","('gnp', 'money-fx', 'yen')","('money-fx',)"

2146,"world recession unlikely - deutsche's herrhausen a world recession is unlikely this year as fiscal and monetary policy in most industrialized countries is supporting the economy, deutsche bank ag <dbkg.f> management board joint spokesman alfred herrhausen said.     but growth rates will be smaller than last year, with 1.5 to 2.5 pct likely in most industrialized countries, he told a news conference.     herrhausen said he was confident private consumption would support economic growth in west germany this year, with net income increases turning into purchasing power as long as inflation did not revive.     herrhausen said he did not expect interest rates to rise in west germany this year, but there was little room for further falls. rates in the u.s. were however rising, as evidenced by the latest prime rate moves, but this rise would be moderate.     herrhausen said he did not expect any major narrowing of the u.s. trade and budget deficits in the next few months.     one success of the paris agreement in february to foster currency stability was that u.s. officials have stopped talking down the dollar, he noted.     the recent stability would last until markets decided to test the resolve of central banks, he said.     he noted that central banks had spent some 10 billion dlrs this week to stabilize the dollar against the yen in the first such test.     ""a massive attack on the mark, which could come if we get bad news out of the u.s., would require a much higher intervention amount, raising the danger of inflation,"" he said.     turning to the international debt problem, herrhausen said brazil's unilateral debt moratorium had surprised banks.     but the move showed that a real solution to debt problems was only possible with the involvement of all parties.  reuter ;","('dlr', 'interest', 'money-fx')","('money-fx',)"
2147,"taiwan foreign exchange reserves hit new high taiwan's foreign exchange reserves hit a new high of more than 51 billion u.s. dlrs on march 4, compared with 50 billion in mid-february and 25.1 billion a year earlier, the central bank said.     bank governor chang chi-cheng told reporters the increase came mainly from the bank's purchases of more than one billion u.s. dlrs on the local interbank market between february 18 and march 4.     he said the rise showed signs of slowing, however, because taiwan has liberalised import policy and expects its trade surplus to decline over the next few months as a result.     chang declined to predict how high the reserves might rise, but local economists have forecast they will hit 60 billion u.s. dlrs by the end of 1987.     in january, taiwan reduced import tariffs of up to 50 pct on some 1,700 foreign products. it had been under growing u.s. pressure to cut its 1986 record 13.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the u.s. taiwan's 1985 surplus with the u.s. was 10.2 billion, according to official statistics.     wang chang-ming, vice chairman of the council for economic planning and development, told reuters the government is planning another round of deep tariff cuts in the second half of this year.     the reserves could support imports of more than two years for taiwan, compared with about three months for japan and the u.s.  reuter ;","('reserves', 'trade')","('trade',)"

2149,"baker seen winning german interest rates battle the united states appears to have won a transatlantic battle by forcing the bundesbank to trim interest rates, european economists said.     but they added washington set the stakes high by testing the limits of the louvre accord while global stock markets were plunging.     west german finance minister gerhard stoltenberg and u.s. treasury secretary james baker reaffirmed their commitment to currency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in frankfurt, according to official statements released late monday.     only 13 hours after the statements were released, the bundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banks liquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pct facility rate offered last week.     while the two ministers were meeting with bundesbank president karl otto poehl, the central bank had also added money market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want a strong rise in the tender allocation rate on tuesday.      ""it's round one to the americans, "" said richard reid, senior european economist for brokers ubs/philips and drew in london.     but reid added, ""we shouldn't forget that it has taken one of the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the west germans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05 percentage point.""     over the weekend, criticism by baker of earlier tightening of west german monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and fuelled speculation that the louvre accord was no longer valid.     six leading industrial nations agreed under february's louvre accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary policies. it has since been reaffirmed by the group of seven - the us, japan, west germany, britain, france, italy and canada.     the frankfurt meeting on monday soothed currency markets and the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading in new york. at the frankfurt fixing on tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on monday.     guenther aschoff, chief economist at deutsche genossenschaftbank in frankfurt said massive declines on world stock markets had been the main reason for the fall in west german short-term interest rates on tuesday.     ""the bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market losses... that was the responsible thing to do and if it fits with baker's wishes, then all the better,"" he said.     no central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and the bundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises in the u.s., aschoff said.     poehl told a conference in frankfurt on tuesday the central bank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he thought the global rate increase was a cause for concern.     giles keating, economist with credit suisse first boston ltd in london said ""the cautious bundesbank has beaten a retreat and baker has won a battle...but he hasn't won the war as the security repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was before the imf meeting last month in washington.""     before the imf meeting, when the louvre accord was reaffirmed, the bundesbank was offering money market liquidity at 3.60 pct, keating noted.     economists said the united states now appeared to have agreed to play by the rules of the louvre accord and support the dollar in return for the german action on interest rates.     any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder washington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, stoltenberg told a news conference on tuesday. he added he would not rule out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening on exchange markets to defend the dollar's value.     deutsche genossenschaftbank's aschoff stressed west germany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency stability. in addition, both the u.s. and west german central banks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them to again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar.  reuter ;","('interest', 'money-fx')","('money-fx',)"

2157,"palm oil output seen dropping sharply - oil world malaysian and indonesian palm oil production is likely to drop sharply this year, due to lower yields, the hamburg-based newsletter oil world said.     the publication expects total malaysian output during jan/sept 1987 to decline by eight pct to 3.05 mln tonnes. for east malaysia, it put production during the period at 297,000 tonnes after 312,000 a year earlier and for west malaysia 2.75 mln compared with just over 3.0 mln during jan/sept 1986.     it said new plantings had slowed markedly in both countries, but the effects of this will not be felt until 1988-90.     above normal yields during recent years resulted in trees reacting to the stress by changing the sex ratio to more male inflorescences and/or aborting more female, oil world said.     yields per hectare are also likely to be adversely affected this year by insufficient rain up to 25 months ago. this could especially affect trees in west malaysia during april/june, while in east malaysia the impact will be in february/april and july/dec, and in indonesia july/sept.     last year's cut in fertilizer use will hit this year's yields and bigger effects are expected within the next three years, oil world said without elaborating.     opening stocks in west malaysia at the start of this year were put at only 565,000 tonnes compared with 914,000 in january 1986, oil world said.     west malaysian net exports are therefore expected to drop 500,000 tonnes to 2.54 mln during jan/sept, while those of east malaysia are likely to decline by 10 pct to 280,000 tonnes.     indonesian palm oil production is forecast to fall about eight pct during jan/may, but to rise from june on. overall indonesian output during jan/sept is forecast to rise three pct to 933,000 tonnes. indonesian stocks as of april 1, however, are put at only 65,000 tonnes compared with 160,000 a year ago.     indonesian export commitments and domestic requirements are both running at high levels, oil world said, and it expects the country's imports to reach a record 110,000 tonnes during jan/sept. the bulk of this will arrive during feb/may, ahead of the april elections and the religious ramadan festival throughout may, it said.     indonesian net exports, therefore, may fall by 29 pct to 350,000 tonnes, oil world said. the possibility that recent indonesian palm oil purchases will not actually enter the country but be transshipped to other countries to fulfill indonesia's export orders cannot be ruled out, it said.  reuter ;","('palm-oil', 'veg-oil')","('palm-oil', 'veg-oil')"

2172,"cbt traders look ahead to spring plantings chicago board of trade grain traders and analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to handle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of new crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans in the futures markets.     professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because corn is protected by the acreage reduction program. that gives deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low.     farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they sign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees.     with the price outlook for both commodities so dismal, traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing rather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new crop soybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more attractive under normal circumstances.     an announcement late friday that the usda will lift the limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop, means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln more oat acres this year than last without being penalized, traders said.     here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking of shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to the more attractive deal from the government, they added.     cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six months ago, which should prompt many farmers in the south to put soybean land back into cotton.     one of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in traditional cotton producing regions of the south to soybeans, which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.  reuter ;","('cotton', 'grain', 'oat', 'oilseed', 'soybean', 'wheat')","('corn', 'grain')"

2184,"economic spotlight - telecom is key japan ministry japan's little-known ministry of posts and telecommunications (mpt) has emerged as an international force to be reckoned with, political analysts said.     mpt, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the u.s. and britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians, they said.     ""the ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of a key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,"" said one diplomatic source.     ""they are a potent political force,"" the diplomatic source said.     but mpt is finding domestic political prowess does not always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts said.     ""the ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not so internationalized,"" said waseda university professor mitsuru uchida. ""suddenly they're standing at the centre of the world community and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how to face the situation.""     most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with london over efforts by britain's cable and wireless plc to keep a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in japan's lucrative overseas telephone business.     the ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one competitor to kokusai denshin denwa co ltd, which now monopolizes the business.     it has also opposed a major management role in the planned merger for any non-japanese overseas telecommunications firm on the grounds that no such international precedent exists.     the ministry's stance has outraged both london, which has threatened to retaliate, and washington, which says the merger plan is evidence of japan's failure to honour pledges to open its telecommunications market.     washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it says have limited access for u.s. firms to japan's car telephone and satellite communications market.     much of mpt's new prominence stems from the growth of the sector it regulates.     ""what has been happening is an important shift in the economy which makes the ministry a very important place,"" said james abegglen, head of the consulting firm asia advisory service inc.     a decision to open the telecommunications industry to competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted rather than lessened mpt's authority, analysts said.     ""with the legal framework eased, they became the de facto legal framework,"" said bache securities (japan) analyst darrell whitten.     close links with the powerful political faction of the ruling liberal democratic party (ldp) nurtured by former prime minister kakuei tanaka are another key to mpt's influence, the analysts said.     ""other factions ignored mpt (in the 1970s), but the tanaka faction was forward looking and ... recognized the importance of mpt,"" uchida said. many former bureaucrats became members of the influential political group, he added.     the ministry also has power in the financial sector due to the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the postal savings system, analysts said.     mpt has helped block finance ministry plans to deregulate interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial liberalisation, since the change would remove the postal savings system's ability to offer slightly higher rates than banks, they said.     diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as mpt's obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized the ministry as feudal.     critics charge mpt with protecting its own turf, limiting competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its wing. providing consumers with the best service at the lowest price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.     but many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the western world including britain, several analysts said.     ""the united states is really the odd man out,"" abegglen said.

2205,"texas commerce <tcb> sees improvement in 1987 texas commerce bancshares inc said that relatively stable oil prices and the bank's planned merger with chemical new york corp <chl> would help 1987 earnings increase from last year's profits of 20 mln dlrs.     texas commerce chairman ben love, in an interview with reuters, did not elaborate on how much the bank expected earnings to increase.     ""we would anticipate that this year would be an improvement over last because we are stronger,"" love said, referring to texas commerce's pending 1.19 billion dlr merger with chemical. the merger, which may be finalized as early as may 1, will lower texas commerce's cost of funding by an estimated 10 to 15 basis points, love said.     the texas commerce-chemical merger is the only acquisition by a major out-of-state bank since texas lawmakers approved interstate banking effective january 1.     hard-hit by loan losses in energy and real estate in texas' struggling economy, the only major texas banks able to report profits in 1986 were texas commerce and republicbank which earned 54.0 mln dlrs. allied bancshares inc <albn> lost 17.6 mln dlrs, mcorp <m> lost 82.1 mln dlrs, interfirst lost 326.5 mln dlrs and first city bancorporation <fbt>, which is actively seeking a merger or other form of new capital, lost 402.0 mln dlrs.     love said texas commerce had turned the corner on its energy loan portfolio problems, but added that the bank's nonperforming real estate loans may increase during 1987.     ""i think the tidal wave in energy has passed over us,"" he said. ""the fact that the real estate market is still moving away suggests there could be some continuing growth of nonperforming loans.""     in 1986, about 42 pct of texas commerce's net loan losses related to real estate lending and 13 pct was due to energy loan losses. that compares to 1985 when only 17 pct of the bank's losses were in real estate and energy accounted for 43 pct.     more than half of texas commerce's nonperforming loans, which totaled 968 mln dlrs at yearend 1986, up from 840 mln dlrs the year before, were in real estate.     love said he believed the real estate loan problems for texas commerce and other major state banks would peak by the third or fourth quarter of 1987. absorption of empty office buildings in houston, which has a current vacancy rate of about 30 pct, will be a gradual process that could take up to four years, he said.     ""i think we may be beginning to stabilize this economy. oil at 18 dlrs a barrel brings much more confidence than 10 dlrs a barrel,"" he said.     texas commerce will retain its name as a separate subsidiary of chemical and plans to aggressively expand its holdings throughout texas, offering additional products to build up its consumer banking business, love said. ""we are resuming what we did best for years -- an offensive position,"" he said.     in january, texas commerce acquired a failed bank in montgomery county, adjacent to the houston metropolitan area, and earlier this month opened a new bank in san antonio. texas commerce plans to add more banks in san antonio and in the dallas-fort worth area where it currently has only 16 member banks, he said.     one day after the texas commerce acquisition was announced in december, interfirst corp <ifc> and republicbank corp <rpt>, both headquartered in dallas, agreed to merge in a deal valued at 570 mln dlrs.     the combination of former archrivals republicbank and interfirst, giving the two banks a virtual lock on the dallas banking market, has not changed texas commerce's expansion plans for the state's second-largest city, love said. ""we think we can try to get a little part of their roost,"" he said.     the chemical partnership will also give texas commerce an edge in developing new consumer products, he said.     ""we have always been a wholesale bank but we have more than one million customers all over the state. chemical will show us how to take advantage of enhancing our consumer products,"" he said, referring to expansion of such existing products as credit cards and investment banking.  reuter ;","('earn',)","('acq',)"

2225,"near term strength seen for currency futures currency futures are likely to move higher following the sharp rally today after president reagan announced that paul volcker would not accept a third term as federal reserve chairman and that alan greenspan was nominated as his replacement, currency analysts said.     contrary to predictions before the volcker resignation, analysts are calling for higher currency futures prices between now and the june 8 venice economic summit.     in particular, uncertainty about greenspan's attitude to the dollar could undermine sentiment toward the u.s. currency, analysts said.     greenspan said today that the dollar appeared to be nearing a bottom, but the market will bear in mind his remarks in chicago last week that the dollar's recent move upward was a technical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower, analysts said.         ""disappointment of european central bankers over the appointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollar lower,"" said manufacturers hanover futures vice president carol mackoff.     ""the international community will not like this appointment,"" as it suggests the possibility that the u.s. budget deficit is too much of a burden on monetary policy and that volcker was unable to get the commitment he sought to reduce the deficit, added merrill lynch economics analyst david horner.      furthermore, ""that greenspan was not named two months ago suggests that he was not the administration's first choice -- and that the status of his appointment was as a bridesmaid,"" horner said.     a declining dollar scenario with higher currency futures prior to and throughout the venice meetings would be mitigated only by concrete action as opposed to ""jawboning"" at the g-7 summit, he said.     but g-7 finance ministers, judged by recent statements, may be at an impasse, analysts said.     japan and west germany today reiterated that neither planned further interest rate cuts, despite pressure from the u.s. to do so, mackoff said.     the u.s., on the other hand, has not cut its budget deficit as japan and west germany have urged, she said.     should g-7 members force a u.s. commitment to cut its budget deficit in the next two years, a further decline in the dollar could be forestalled, horner said.     however, ""the impact from venice will be nothing if nothing changes,"" horner said.     smith barney, harris upham and co. analyst craig sloane said european currencies will likely move to the higher end of their 1987 ranges after today's sharp advance.     for the next two weeks, sloan calls for september yen futures to advance toward the 0.007200 area. he said september marks could close in on 0.5700 as an upside target, while swiss francs could climb to a range between 0.6900 and 0.6950.  reuter ;","('money-fx',)","('money-fx',)"

""attempts last week to win a compromise on both the bond issue and the larger dispute failed,"" james kinnear, texaco's president and chief executive officer, told reporters.     kinnear said pennzoil's disclosure in court papers on friday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing until the end of april, pushed texaco further towards chapter 11.     pennzoil had asked texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cash bond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct of earnings. pennzoil also wanted assurances that texaco would not sell any assets, kinnear said.     texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter of credit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under 11.1 billion dlrs, he added.     joseph jamail, a houston attorney for pennzoil, said the company had made its latest settlement offer to texaco on saturday and was taken by surprise when texaco filed for bankruptcy.     he declined to reveal the amount of the proposal, citing a confidentiality agreement between the two companies. ""texaco told us they would get back to us but instead they chose to go to bankruptcy court,"" jamail said.     attorneys for pennzoil said they believed the company would prevail in court appeals, adding that texaco's assets were ample ultimately to pay the pennzoil judgment in full.  reuter ;","('earn',)","('crude',)"

2287,"saudi businessmen to discuss private sector saudi arabian business leaders assembled for a conference aimed at thrashing out problems facing the private sector of the kingdom's oil-dependent economy.     the meeting of some 500 top businessmen from across saudi arabia comes at a time of guarded optimism in industry and commerce following the opec pact to boost world oil prices.     the four-day conference in this resort town, high in the mountains above the tihamah plain stretching to the red sea, has been organised by saudi arabia's chambers of commerce.     finance minister mohammed ali abal-khail and commerce minister suleiman abdulaziz al-salim will attend the first day.     bankers and businessmen said the conference will air problems facing commerce and industry after last year's slide in oil prices and examine ways to promote higher investment in a private sector sorely short of finance.     government planners have long recognised that saudi arabia, the world's largest crude exporter, needs to foster private enterprise to diversify its oil-based economy.     the fledgling private sector was hard hit by the middle east recession as early as 1983 and several big manufacturing and trading companies ran into problems repaying loans.     renewed optimism this year stems largely from the accord reached by opec last december to curb oil output and boost prices to a benchmark level of 18 dlrs per barrel.     with oil prices recovering, saudi arabia went ahead at the turn of the year with long-delayed budget plans incorporating a 52.7 billion riyal deficit to be bridged by drawing down foreign reserves.     the simple act of publishing a budget restored a measure of confidence to the business community.     some share prices have risen by more than 35 pct since last november, while banks are generally reporting a slowdown in the number of new non-performing loans.     but not all bankers are convinced. one senior corporate finance manager in riyadh said: ""banks are still reluctant to lend ... there is certainly more optimism in the air, but i am not sure if it is firmly based.""     some businessmen and bankers point out that government spending is still under tight control and the non-oil economy may still be contracting.     capital expenditure on large projects has been cut sharply. a u.s. embassy report on saudi arabia published just before the budget said: ""while industrialisation has continued to be one of the government's highest priorities, the recession, the payments problem and the lack of financing have reduced saudi and foreign investor interest in industry.""     it is the lack of fresh investment that is expected to be a major issue among the businessmen gathered here.     official figures show the number of new licences for industrial ventures fell 24 pct in the six months to march 1986, compared with the same period in 1985.     lending by the saudi industrial development fund, a major source of industry backing, has fallen steadily since 1983.     trading companies have also been hit, some caught with huge inventories of construction equipment as recession bit.     some firms laid off workers and cut bloated inventories. others have effectively been liquidated. a few have reached agreement with bankers to extend debt repayments.     the latest rescheduling is for the shipping-to-hotels conglomerate redec. its negotiators have just initialled a draft accord to restructure payments on 1.3 billion riyals of bank debt.     bankers and businessmen said the conference was also likely to discuss the apparent reluctance of u.s. and british firms to step up investment in the kingdom.     a british government delegation has just left riyadh after holding preliminary talks on ways of offsetting the huge saudi outlay on a defence contract to supply 132 fighter aircraft worth five billion stg.  reuter ;","('crude',)","('crude',)"
2288,"bank of england resists pressure for rate cut the bank of england again fought against money and bond market pressure for a pre-budget interest rate cut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise in its trade-weighted index to a six-month high.     it closed at its best level since september 12, at 71.4 pct of its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continued to buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and the possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said.     meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the bank can stop a cut before budget day, march 17, and why it should want to.     the bank's latest strong signal to the market that it wants rates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, when it lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct to relieve a money market shortage.     ""they're really making the discount houses suffer,"" said stephen lewis, economist at brokerage house phillips and drew. ""eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates.""     this money market signal was apparently not accompanied by any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which had inhibited strong rises yesterday and tuesday, so buyers came strongly into the pound.     the pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the london close, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60 marks, up from 2.8720/50.     ""if this pressure keeps up...there is a possibility that rates could drop before the budget,"" said jeremy hale, economist at finance house goldman sachs international corp.     some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in the base rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow.     however, analysts said the bank of england will need to be convinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-rating rather than a result of short-term speculative gains.     there are valid reasons for the bank to be cautious, said peter fellner, u.k. economist at brokers james capel and co.     markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of a conservative party victory in any early general election, and disappointment if prime minister margaret thatcher decides to hold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback for bonds, fellner said.     an election could be delayed until mid-1988, but most forecasts say it will be this year.     others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to oil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar.     however, analysts agree the bank is largely trying to set the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether.     the authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable rate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there.     some add the bank will be influenced by signs that at least a proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-term capital coming into the london market, notably from japan.     they argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet than the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls and current political upheavals in washington.     the bank may want to see another few points on the trade-weighted index before the budget, argued lewis. ""but by then sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the bank of england,"" he added.     the bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting pressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more than just marking up by foreign exchange traders.     meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially harmful news on the trade front, today's figures showing that the current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg.     this was above previous estimates of the current account deficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985.     fellner said that under more normal conditions this would have given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals.     the guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing banks divided as well as the markets. privately, some bank officials forecast the bank will hold out at least for this week, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow. if a move comes before march 17, forecasts are for a half-point cut, with another half or full point about budget day.  reuter ;","('interest',)","('interest',)"

2299,"iea forecasts slower growth in oecd oil demand growth in oil consumption in the western industrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the international energy agency said.     oil use in the 24 member countries of the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) increased by around one pct in the first quarter of 1987 to 35.9 mln barrels a day, the iea said in its latest monthly report.     growth in oecd countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels, as was the case in 1986. but if average consumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct.     the iea said assuming crude and product prices remain nar current levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected.     if that takes place, natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, it said.     iea estimates on april one put oil stocks held in the oecd area at 428 mln tonnes, or 98 days of forward consumption. this is about the same as at the begining of the year.     the agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks.     company stocks on land in the oecd rose to 326 mln tonnes on april one this year compared with 316 mln tonnes in calender 1986 while governments also built up their strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in 1986.     the year-on-year trend of government stock building is continuing with company stocks rising, more or less in line with consumption, after declining for five years, iea said.     oil stocks on land in the united states and canada were put at 206.6 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on january one and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively.     oil stocks in western europe were 147.4 mln tonnes, down from the 154 mln tonnes on january one but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption.     the iea said that initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in oecd countries in the first quarter of the year. this followed a small rise in january of 400,000 bpd but a decline of 1.5 bpd in february and 2.5 bpd in march.     and it is possible that final data will show a larger draw, particulary for march, it said.     as crude production also fell, there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the iea said.     world oil supply fell through the first quarter by about two bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986.     this drop was mostly due to a decline in opec crude production to around 15.5 bpd in february/march from 16.5 bpd in january and to the seasonal drop in exports from centrally planned economies, the iea said.     total opec oil supply totalled 17.2 bpd in the first quarter of 1987 compare with 19.3 bpd in the last three months of 1986 while supply from non-opec countries totalled 28 bpd as against 28.2 bpd in the same 1986 period.     a drop in saudi arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 bpd in march from 3.6 bpd in february was the largest factor behind the opec production decline, the iea said.  reuter ;","('crude',)","('crude',)"

2303,"german money market split on lower rate prospects remarks by central bankers raised some hopes the bundesbank will cut rates on securities repurchase pacts, but operators remained divided on the likelihood of a move in the near term, money market dealers said.     comments by bundesbank board member claus koehler yesterday that rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth from speculative capital inflows, and by west berlin state central bank president dieter hiss that there was no natural lower limit to the discount rate had, however, no immediate impact.     call money declined to 3.65/75 pct from 3.75/85 pct but the drop was tied to extra liquidity in the market, dealers said.     dealers said the bundesbank's latest liquidity allotment this week dashed some hopes of lower rates.     the bundesbank allotted only 6.1 billion marks yesterday in new liquidity in a repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of 3.80 pct, thus subtracting some 8.8 billion marks from the market, as an outgoing 14.9 billion pact expired.     but some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by the pact was in line with present liquid money market conditions, and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to 3.70 pct if money market rates continue at present levels.     the next opportunity for the bundesbank to lower rates on repurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next tuesday.     bundesbank officials have already said they favour more discreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather than the more public adjustment of leading rates.     the bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate and allow banks to tender for the volume, as has been the case since it lowered its discount rate january 22, or else it may allow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself.     dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the 15.2 billion marks flowing out, to offset other incoming funds.     some seven billion marks is expected to flow in next week. this should then flow back into the market as it is deposited with banks.     banks were well supplied with liquidity, holding 61.5 billion marks in reserves at the bundesbank on tuesday.     holdings of average daily reserves over the first seven days of april stood at 59.6 billion marks, still above the estimated 51 billion required for all of april.  reuter ;","('interest', 'money-fx')","('interest',)"

""all areas must spare no effort to raise the autumn harvest area, especially of corn, sweet potatoes, paddy rice and high-yield cash crops,"" it said.     it added factory production might have to be reduced to provide electricity for agriculture if it was needed to fight the drought.     since january, the press has devoted much attention to grain, stressing that growth in output is vital to china's economic and political stability and that prices paid to farmers are too low.     officials in east china have repeatedly said stable grain production is a key state policy and outlined the measures being taken in their areas to encourage output.     the shanghai official said that in one suburb, 10 pct of the pre-tax profits of factories are used to subsidise agriculture. he said rural industries in other suburbs also set aside money for grain and pay the salaries of some of the 70,000 workers available to help farmers.     chu jinfeng, an official of fengbing county outside shanghai, said factory workers get 60 yuan a month and three years unpaid leave to grow grain and can keep the profits.     pan huashan, an official of the agricultural department of zhejiang province, said rural industry also subsidises grain output in his province.     ""in addition, we are setting up grain production bases, raising the level of science and technology on the farms and improving the supply of raw materials, roads and other infrastructure,"" he said.     the shanghai official said rural residents who work in industry or commerce usually keep their land to farm in their spare time, or let other family members farm it. in some cases, they lease the land to grain farmers.     the china daily said last month that grain output should reach between 425 and 450 mln tonnes by 1990 and between 480 and 500 mln by 2000. it said growing grain should be made profitable.     ""the advantages the state promises grain growers actually yield tangible profits for them and are not siphoned off by intermediate agencies because of bureaucracy or corruption. only this will boost enthusiasm,"" it said.  reuter ;","('grain',)","('trade',)"

""i believe that the prospect of debt relief would undermine the difficult internal efforts of the borrowing countries to achieve the structural reform that is needed regardless of the policies that are followed on servicing external debt,"" volcker said.     it might also cause private lenders to become reluctant to extend more credit to the borrowing countries, he said.     volcker said he endorsed comments by treasury secretary james baker ""about the inappropriateness of using public resources for purchasing private commercial bank debt, which we both see as an inherent aspect of the proposed international debt facility.""     he also said a proposal for establishing formal procedures for international negotiations on currency exchange rates ""is unrealistic and could well have damaging effects.""     ""for example, the bill's directive to intitiate negotiations in order to achieve a competitive exchange rate for the dollar -- a matter upon which there can be considerable difference among analysts -- runs the risk of building up potentially destabilizing market expectations,"" volcker said.     he recommended ""we should not lock ourselves into formalized procedures for international negotiations"" on exchange rates but instead use other, more flexible means like the recent mmeting in paris between u.s. treasury and central bank representatives and those of major trade allies.  reuter ;","('money-fx', 'trade')","('trade',)"

""it would seem obvious that an offering would decrease the health club unit's debt, increase its cash flow and operating income, making it an attractive buy to a third party,"" steven eisenberg of bear stearns said.     on monday, bally said it filed with the securities and exchange commission for an initial offering of 24 pct, or 5.8 mln shares, of the unit's common stock at 13-15 dlrs a share.    about half the proceeds, 40 mln dlrs, will be used to reduce parent bally manufacturing's debt which has swelled to 1.6 billion dlrs due to recent hotel acquisitions and the purchase of shares from donald trump who had threatened a hostile takeover, according to bally treasurer paul johnson.     remaining proceeds from the stock offering and from a separate offering of 50 mln dlrs of 20-year convertible subordinated debt would be used to repay about 75 mln dlrs of short term senior bank debt of the health chain unit, a bally spokesperson said.     analysts said bally's health club unit's profits have remained strong, but are skeptical about the industry's long range prospects.     ""the fitness club industry, over the last 10 years, has grown tremendously, but the question is whether its a fad or a permanent part of our lifestyle,"" said eisenberg of bear stearns.     analysts said fitness clubs will likely flourish if the public stays at its peak of health consciousness, but that overcapacity is likely to occur as consumer enthusiasm wanes.      in addition, ""the returns in the fitness club industry are just not as high as they are in the gaming industry,"" said one analyst.      there are about 6,500 fitness clubs in the u.s., excluding clubs run by not-for-profit organizations, according to the association of physical fitness centers who estimates it to be an 8.0-billion-dlr-a-year industry.      asked if anyone has offered to buy the unit, which is the nation's largest health club chain, peltier said, ""no one has the money to offer to buy it.""

""it makes no sense to abandon this policy now when exploration is at its lowest level for many years and when australia's oil self-sufficency is expected to decline rapidly,"" massy-green said.  reuter ;","('crude', 'earn', 'nat-gas')","('crude',)"

2381,"u.s. gasoline surplus seen over near term unless u.s. refiners reduce the amount of gasoline they now produce, the oil industry will enter the coming summer driving season with the largest surplus of motor fuel since 1984, oil analysts and traders said.     ""they key question is how much gasoline refiners produce in the coming weeks,"" said larry goldstein of petroleum industry research inc. ""if refiners cut output and demand turns upward, gasoline stocks could begin to draw, and the surplus could potentially turn around in four to eight weeks,"" said goldstein.     the american petroleum institute said u.s. gasoline stocks for the week ended april 17 are 37.6 mln barrels above last year's levels, and analysts said they don't believe the expected one to two pct rise in demand will take care of the surplus before the start of the summer driving season, which begins memorial day weekend.     the api said the last time stocks were this high was in 1984, when there was a 27 mln barrel excess. oil traders said that the surplus held throughout the summer of 1984, depressing prices for the motor fuel.     over the past several weeks, analysts said they expected refiners to reduce production because there was no profit in continued production of gasoline due to the surplus. however, refineries continued to operate at higher levels, they said.     u.s. refineries have been running at about 78.8 pct of capacity during march and april this year, compared to 77.5 at this time last year, api statistics show.     because of the current excess in stocks, one planner for a major oil company said he believed that most companies are contemplating cutting refinery throughput over the near term.     he said some refiners appear to be selling less aggressively in order to have product on hand to meet the expected rise in demand this summer.     goldstein said that other factors, such as higher speed limits, the gasoline lead phasedown, and possible new restrictions on gasoline vapor pressure could tighten the supply situation this summer.     however, a planner at another major oil company said that although large inventories are dampening the price outlook for gasoline this season, he does not expect refiners to cut output soon.     that oil company planner said high crude oil runs reduce the refiner's average costs, making the incremental barrel of gasoline cheaper to produce.     most analysts expect a slight upturn this summer over the summer of 1986. bo poates, an analyst at the energy futures group inc said he foresees demand up about one pct in the second and third quarters of 1987.     chase econometrics' scott jones sees gasoline demand rising 1.9 to 2.2 pct for the year, due mainly to continued low prices.  reuter ;","('gas',)","('crude',)"

""fundamentally, the market situation is bullish and the official price will be 20 dlrs in january,"" a japanese refiner said.     the sources said that in spite of over-production by opec members such as iraq, the united arab emirates, kuwait and qatar, demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter.     spot oil prices surged on friday in late u.s. trading as the market anticipated an opec agreement on second-half 1987 output. in early tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrs for mideast dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs for u.k. brent, traders said.     they said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into the u.s. market as the benchmark crude west texas intermediate (wti) trades at around 20.30 dlrs.     ""with wti at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, u.s. refiners will import mideast and far east crudes and this will strengthen those grades further,"" said a japanese oil trader.     some tokyo traders were cautious about whether thu spot market has further upward potential in the short term, having risen strongly on the opec news on friday.     ""you could certainly argue that if new york rose on that basis, there's no reason for prices to go up again today,"" said one international oil trader in tokyo.     ""but i think if there's any sign of a dip, it will be bought back up again pretty quickly,"" he added.     one oil industry analyst concurred, ""there is no reason to expect a weak market from now on."" he said he expected opec to raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on december 9.     oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly in the next few months due to cheating by some opec members and the likelihood that saudi arabia will act as swing producer to maintain steady prices.     iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day compared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said. its export capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipeline through turkey, comes onstream in or around september.     qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd, against its opec-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting up to 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said.     iran, the united arab emirates and kuwait are also cheating on the opec agreement with over-production and effective price discounts through counter-purchases, industry sources said. but they mostly agreed that saudi arabia will unofficially act as swing producer, cutting production to compensate for higher output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise too high too fast.     saudi arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln barrels.

2430,"indonesia pressing for compromise over coffee indonesian coffee exporters are preparing for a period of depressed prices while urging their government to lobby for a resolution of the deadlocked issue of export quotas, the chairman of the association of indonesian coffee exporters (aice) told reuters.     dharyono kertosastro said in an interview that indonesia, the world's third largest producer, is trimming costs and improving its marketing while seeking a compromise on quotas.     ""but as long as brazil sticks to its hardline position, we can never bridge the gap,"" dharyono said.     indonesia was one of a group of eight producing countries, along with costa rica, the dominican republic, ecuador, honduras, india, papua new guinea and peru, which proposed a new quota system at last month's failed international coffee organistion (ico) talks in london.     brazil, which would have had its quota reduced under the group of eight scheme, blocked the proposal.     aice officials are now hoping colombia can use its contacts with brazil to suggest a compromise.     edward muda, an aice official who attended the ico negotiations, said latin american members of the group of eight were in contact with colombia, the world's second largest producer, but gave no details.     ""colombia has shown interest because they will gain from a compromise. without one, they will suffer if the present market stays like it is,"" muda said.     he said indonesia was in contact with consumers such as the u.s., japan, the netherlands, west germany and canada ahead of an ico executive board meeting scheduled for april 1.     dharyono said the aice will send delegations to the u.s. and japan to brief indonesian embassy officials there and press them to present indonesia's case more firmly.     he urged the indonesian government to do more to help the country's coffee traders through the ico negotiations.     muda said the group of eight had some common ground with the big consumers because they agreed on the need for basing quotas on what he termed ""realistic criteria.""     the breakaway group believes the old quota system, which gives brazil a 30 pct share of the quota exports, does not reflect up-to-date supply and demand trends.     brazil has stuck rigidly to its insistence that the old system be applied.     export quotas were suspended in february 1986 when market prices surged because of the failure of the brazilian crop.     although prices have long since come down to a point where export controls could be reintroduced, producers and consumers at the 75-member ico have not been able to agree on new guidelines. brazil and the u.s., the largest consumer, are both refusing to alter their positions.     dharyono said if new quotas are not agreed he believed indonesia was well placed to survive low prices.     indonesian farmers are trimming production costs and the aice is improving its marketing system, dharyono said.     indonesia's coffee output in 1986/87, ending september 30, is expected to stagnate or fall slightly from last year's level of 360,000 tonnes, he said.     he said stocks, at 90,000 tonnes, were about average for the time of year.  reuter ;","('coffee',)","('coffee',)"

""it does reduce the bank's exposure in energy loans and 54 mln dlrs is a substantial amount,"" archibold said, ""but the deal represents only about four pct of their energy loans.""     of first city's total loan portfolio of 9.9 mln dlrs, about 14 pct or 1.4 billion dlrs were made to energy producers or suppliers, analysts said. its record losses have been caused by its past status as one of the nation's top lenders to oil and gas producers and suppliers during the boom days of the late 1970s and early 1980s.     first city said about half of the loans sold to prudential came from its energy finance co., an entity formed in 1982 to loan money to ""more venturesome"" oil borrowers that promised a higher potential return. the other half of the loans were from first city's lead bank in houston.     chris kotowski, an analyst with oppenheimer and co., said the sale of the package of energy loans was the first encouraging news from first city in months.     ""it's not going to solve all of first city's problems but it's a good transaction for them. it may be possible for them to sell additional loans,"" kotowski said.

""the m-1 surge will be very temporary. about two thirds of the increase is likely to be washed out in the following week,"" said kim rupert, an economist at money market services inc.     rupert said a huge increase in m-1 for the april 20 week is implied by very strong deposit survey data and by an unexpectedly sharp gain in required reserves in federal reserve data released thursday.     those numbers, covering the two-week bank statement period that ended on april 22, show a 2.5 billion dlr jump in basic required reserves. economists said this largely reflected the parking in checking accounts of the proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to pay annual income taxes. fed seasonal adjustments do not adequately compensate for these and other special factors.     analysts noted that income tax refunds from the treasury also appear to be coming earlier than usual.     they also are not adequately compensated for by the fed's seasonal adjustment factors to the money supply.     the federal reserve is no longer targeting m-1 because the link between m-1 and economic growth has largely been severed by financial market innovation and deregulation.     as such, there is likely to be little financial market reaction to the huge m-1 increase that is expected to be announced next week.  reuter ;","('money-supply',)","('money-supply',)"

""we have seen contractors put at competitive disadvantages in nations in which they had worked successfully for years essentially moved aside to make room for locally-owned firms or a locally-built rig,"" he said.      tappmeyer, who is president of the international association of drilling contractors, said how far the trend would spread depends on the growth of trade protectionism.      he added that international contractors will increasingly find their role restricted to regions that require special expertise and experience, such as wildcat areas and severe environments such as in the arctic and extremely deep waters.      tappmeyer also said he expects producing companies to provide the main financing for offshore drilling in the coming decade as banks will be unwilling to repeat overexposing themselves and drilling contractors will have difficulty providing financing out of cash flow.      at the same time, he said he saw the financing as indirect as he does not see producers getting back in the rig-owning business.      he also said projectfinancing will have to be backed up by work commitments to guarantee the payoff of construction costs.      for the time being, he said there was a superabundance of rigs. but he said there will be a need for new, technologically advanced rigs within a few years.      he said the floating-drilling rigs were most likely to benefit from new developments in technology, adding that by 2,000 there should not be an ocean left that is too deep, too cold, too stormy or too remote to be explored.  reuter ;","('crude',)","('crude',)"

2500,"cocoa buffer stock may face uphill battle - trade the international cocoa organization (icco) buffer stock could face an uphill battle to halt the downtrend in world cocoa prices when it begins buying operations in the next few weeks, cocoa traders said.     traders said they believed buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting prices significantly, given the amount of surplus cocoa overhanging the market. the buffer stock may begin buying shortly as the icco 10 day average indicator price is now at 1,578.03 special drawing rights (sdr) per tonne, below the 1,600 ""must buy"" level.     rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed last month by the icco council. buying will begin once the buffer stock manager has completed preparations, traders said.     some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer stock buying until mid or end-april when changes in months used to calculate the icco indicator may lift the 10 day average above the 1,600 sdr ""must buy"" level.     the icco indicator price is calculated from the average of the second, third and fourth positions on the london and new york futures markets. the daily price was 1,577.61 sdr per tonne yesterday.     months used currently for the indicator are may, july and september, but these are set to change to july, september and december on april 15, prior to may becoming the new york spot month, traders noted.     the introduction of december into the calculations may lift the daily sdr price as december is currently quoted about 75 stg above may on the london terminal market.     but the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the higher daily price to feed through into the 10-day average, the indicator which governs his activities, traders said.     ""the buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the implications of delaying until forward prices lift the indicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa,"" an analyst from a leading cocoa trade house said.     traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000 tonnes fairly quickly once buying starts. if purchases reach this level within six months, buying is suspended pending an icco council review of price ranges. but some cocoa market watchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recent forecasts for a poor brazilian bahia temporao crop at 1.5 mln to two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up to three mln.     a lower than expected brazilian crop may cut the 1986/87 world surplus to between 50,000 and 70,000 tonnes, compared with a recent forecast by the icco statistics committee of 94,000 tonnes, traders said.     in these circumstances, the buffer stock may only need to buy between 20,000 and 30,000 tonnes to lift prices above the ""must buy"" level.     but some dealers said the icco buffer stock rules may put constraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock manager can remove cocoa from the market.     the buffer stock system of price differentials set according to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from non-members could limit the buffer stock's scope for action, dealers said.     most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is nearby in-store material of malaysian and ivory coast origin.     but the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct malaysian cocoa as malaysia is not an icco member, while purchases of nearby cocoa can only reach 40 pct in any one day, which forces the buffer stock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material.     limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non-member cocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are pressured by the overhang of malaysian material, traders said.     buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from quality producers such as ghana will have only a limited impact on futures, but is likely to widen physical market premiums for this cocoa over futures.     ghana's premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg from 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer stock buying, dealers said.     ""the buffer stock may not help the terminal market, but will provide a backstop for quality cocoas,"" one trader said.     traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer stock were ""all prognostication"" and that no one could hope to predict accurately what the result would be. psychologically buffer stock buying should help prices, but since the buffer stock already holds a carryover of 100,000 tonnes from the previous cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus, dealers expressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure.     in june the icco is due to discuss rules for a withholding scheme as an additional market support mechanism.  reuter ;","('cocoa',)","('cocoa',)"

""the figures are unreservedly good,"" chase manhattan securities economist andrew wroblewski said.     sterling rebounded on the trade figures, reversing a weaker morning trend, to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted index against a basket of currencies at midday, unchanged from yesterday's close but 0.3 points above the 1100 gmt level.     the market had feared that a deteriorating non-oil trade pattern would undermine international support for sterling, which has been the motor behind the recent fall in u.k. interest rates. money market sources said the market had begun to doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates to 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards.     but sentiment now looks to have turned about again.     there now looks to be no danger that the chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson's forecast of a 1987 current account deficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, wroblewski said.     seasonally adjusted figures showed imports rose in february to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in january.     exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion.     however, chris tinker, u.k. analyst at brokers phillips and drew said the faster rise in exports than imports would prove partly aberrational in coming months. he forecast the chancellor's budget tax cuts would increase consumer expenditure on imported goods.     however, warburg securities economist ian harwood said his firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit forecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billion stg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg.     he said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the confederation of british industry.     the growth in imports appears to be flattening, even if january's bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas goods and import-intensive stock building among manufacturers, harwood said.     u.k. government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2 point on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries about the figures evaporated.     sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling to a steady 1.6050 about 1300 gmt, nearly a cent higher than the european low of 1.5960.     however, analysts noted that the turnabout in market sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news.     morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the conservative government's support was slipping.     london, march 26 - the bank of england said it provided 15 mln stg in assistance to the money market this morning, buying bank bills in band two at 9-13/16 pct.     earlier the bank revised its money market liquidity forecast from a flat position to a deficit of around 350 mln stg.  reuter ;","('bop', 'interest', 'money-fx', 'trade')","('money-fx',)"

""the esso proposal to purchase all the delhi interest will be more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with the float,"" csr chief executive bryan kelman said in the statement.     kelman said the sale of delhi would enable csr to focus efforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and building materials in which csr has had long and successful management experience and strong market leadership.     with the sale, csr will be able to expand those businesses more aggressively and earlier, he said.     as reported separately, soon after announcing the delhi sale csr launched a takeover bid for the 68.26 pct of <pioneer sugar mills ltd> that it does not already hold, valuing its entire issued capital at 219.6 mln dlrs.     after bass strait, the onshore cooper and eromanga basin is australia's largest oil and gas producing area with current gross oil production of 45,000 barrels per day (bdp), gas liquids output of 30,000 bpd and gas sales of 480 mln cubic feet a day, the csr-esso statement said.     the purchase gives esso, a 50/50 partner with the broken hill pty co ltd <brkn.s> in the bass strait, its first onshore production in australia, they said.     esso's chairman stuart mcgill said he hoped esso can assist in maintaining the high rate of oil and gas discoveries in the cooper-eromanga area.     ""these discoveries will help australia's self-sufficiency in oil reserves thereby offsetting in part the decline in bass strait production now under way,"" mcgill said.     in a separately released letter to csr shareholders, kelman said csr was within days of completing plans for the float of csr petroleum when it received an offer from esso.     he said csr is convinced the sale was the correct decision in view of the risks associated with the oil business.     the price-sharing arrangement provides for csr to share equally with esso in higher returns if oil prices average more than 20 u.s. dlrs a barrel in the next two years, he said.     kelman said a revaluation of csr's investment in delhi to net realisable value as of today, csr's annual balance-date, will result in an extraordinary loss of 97 mln dlrs.     however, revaluations and profits on sales of other assets will significantly reduce this loss, he said.     he also said that csr is sufficiently encouraged by future prospects and the opportunity to reposition the group in core businesses to foreshadow an increase in final dividend payable in july to 10 cents from nine to make an annual 19 cents against 18 in 1985/86.  reuter ;","('acq',)","('acq',)"

2628,"trade ministers say governments need credibility four trade ministers ended a weekend meeting with a frank confession that their governments are losing credibility in world financial markets and will not regain it until they back their promises over trade and currencies with action.     ""until today we have anounced policies, but when it came to action required it was done in a way that satisfied nobody,"" japanese trade minister hajime tamura told a news conference.     ""from now on, if a government comes up with a certain policy, it must be followed by action,"" he said following two days of informal talks with the trade ministers of the united states, the european community and canada in central japan.     last week, the dollar fell to a new record low below 140 yen, despite statements from the group of seven (g-7) leading industrial powers that currencies should be stabilised to underpin world trade.     ""we need credibility to gain confidence. when we have confidence, then we can have an impact,"" said tamura.     his colleagues agreed that when major trade nations fought over trade issues while calling for each other to honour free trade rules in general, it was not a sight which inspired confidence in the markets.     ""the time has come now to act in step with the talk. if you belong to a club, you have to act in concord with the rules, if you want to be credible,"" said ec external trade chief willy de clercq.     pat carney of canada said ""we are meeting in a time of great trade tension. what the world needs to see is that we have the political will to deal with these problems we face.""     she said that next month's meeting of the organisation of economic cooperation and development and the meeting of leaders of the g-7 nations in venice in the summer would be a forum to show this will existed.     u.s. trade representative clayton yeutter reminded the news conference that the results of such high level meetings could lead to action which would only have an effect on smoothing out world trade imbalances perhaps years later.     ""the media typically has a tendency to evaluate meetings like this in terms of tangible results. that is not the way it should be pursued,"" he said.

""i'm not so sure we would be interested in getting back into that business.""     however, guinn generally applauded the u.s. recommendations, saying they would give more latitude for the bell operating companies to expand into non-regulated businesses and provide more flexibility to form strategic alliances with other companies.     he added that while the company welcomes the expansion into new areas, it is not currently involved in any acqusition talks.

""it is my hope that delegations will go back home and try to ratify the new agreement,"" he added.     the renegotiation conference, under the auspices of the u.n. conference on trade and development (unctad), is the fourth such meeting in two years.     xuto said producers and consumers had agreed on four points:     1) regular price reviews will be held every 15 months.     previously consumers were proposing 12-month intervals between price reviews instead of 18 in the current pact.     2) if the average of the daily market indicator prices over six months prior to a review is below (or above) the lower intervention price (or the upper intervention price), the reference price will be automatically revised downwards (or upwards) by five pct unless the international natural rubber organisation council decides on a higher percentage.     if buffer stock purchases or sales reach 300,000 tonnes, the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless the council decides on a higher percentage.     3) if the buffer stock reaches 400,000 tonnes, the price at which the additional contingency stock of 150,000 tonnes is brought into operation will be two malaysian/singapore cents above the floor price -- or 152 cents.     4) the floor price will not be breached. throughout the talks producers had adamantly resisted a consumer proposal to lower the floor price of 150 cents if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes.     the proposal, initiated by the u.s., was withdrawn last night, setting the stage for compromise.     legal drafting of provisions will start next week and formal adoption of the new accord by the 40 countries taking part in the conference is expected to take place on march 20.     the current conference was widely seen as the last chance to clinch a deal. three previous attempts to negotiate a new five- year pact had failed, the last round breaking down in october over consumer demands for tighter controls of the buffer stock.     the united states, japan, west germany, france, italy and britain are the major consumers.     unctad's latest estimates project an increase of 8.5 pct in rubber prices this year and 4.1 pct in 1988.  reuter ;","('rubber',)","('rubber',)"

2692,"bundesbank retains money supply policy bundesbank council member lothar mueller said the bank has not given up its money supply policy and that restraining money supply growth does not always mean pushing up interest rates.     mueller said in an article for the boersen zeitung financial daily that a monetary policy which took into account exchange rate expectations and capital flows could not be confused with an exchange rate oriented policy.     the article followed international press speculation that the bundesbank had abandoned money supply targetting in favour of an exchange rate policy.     mueller, a member of the bundesbank council in his position as president of the regional state central bank in bavaria, noted that the bundesbank's decision in january to cut leading interest rates amid continuing strong monetary growth had led some people to think it was dropping monetary targetting.     ""simply to ignore the external economic context would be risky and dangerous for monetary policy,"" he explained.     mueller said the cuts in official interest rates had put an end to interest rate speculation. the bundesbank could now assume that upward pressure on the mark would ease and currency inflows slow down.     lower money market rates, achieved by widening short and long term interest rate differentials, also encouraged investors to re-invest funds parked in liquid accounts, mueller said.     the measures therefore aimed clearly at bringing monetary growth back onto the desired path, he said.     ""finally, of course, and there is no need to keep this quiet, the cut in interest rates was also in line with the changed economic situation of the last few months,"" he added.     ""all in all, the bundesbank in no way abandoned its money supply policy with the january discount rate cut, despite suppositions to the contrary,"" mueller said.     ""keeping money supply developments in check is not always synonymous with raising interest rates, especially when excessive liquidity due to inflows from abroad, rather than growth in bank credits, is the cause of rising monetary holdings of non-banks,"" mueller said.     now that west germany no longer ran large external deficits other concepts were needed for monetary policy.     mueller said it would be both difficult and dangerous for monetary policy to pursue a specific mark/dollar exchange rate.     in any case, the exchange rate partly depends on u.s. currency and budgetary policy and the u.s. economy, he said.     but an exchange rate orientation would also mean the end of a strict stability policy because both interest rates and liquidity would be affected by required currency intervention and could no longer be steered autonomously by the bundesbank.     even interest rates are not in the centre of the bundesbank's considerations, but reflect competition and other market conditions, mueller said.     a cut in bank liquidity will not directly influence central bank money stock, the bundesbank's main money supply indicator.     this does not reflect banking liquidity, but the liquidity of industry and households which cannot be directly reached with the bundesbank's instruments, mueller said.     the less dependent non-banks are on bank credits, the harder it is to steer money supply. this has increasingly been the case recently, because non-banks have received considerable sums from current account surpluses and capital imports.     ""if the bundesbank had tried to brake the money supply rise with higher interest rates, as would have been appropriate if credit was growing excessively, it would not only have missed its target but probably even set off further inflows,"" he said.     mueller said growth in money supply was still too high.     in the last three months money stock grew at an annual rate of seven pct, down from 10 pct in the previous quarter.     the growth curve has therefore come closer to the three to six pct 1987 target corridor for central bank money stock growth, pointing to the success of the current policy, he said.     but high monetary stocks can be a warning sign and there should be no change in priorities. ""monetary policy must be first and foremost stability policy and successful stability policy is money supply policy -- nothing else,"" he said.  reuter ;","('money-fx', 'money-supply')","('money-fx',)"

""i think the merger is not going through,"" said phil pace, analyst at kidder, peabody and co. he said the merger ""lost a lot of its appeal"" when the u.s. department of justice required that baker sell off its reed tool co operation.     although the reed operation is relatively small in view of the total size of a combined baker-hughes, pace said ""30 to 40 pct of the cost savings are tied up in that.""     ""they (hughes) are obviously concerned about the lawsuit,"" said james crandell, analyst at salomon brothers inc.

""it's getting a little confusing,"" said james carroll, analyst at painewebber group inc. he said the arguments cited by hughes yesterday for not doing the merger ""tend to be weak."" hughes said yesterday that as a condition of the merger it wanted reed tool and other businesses sold prior to april 22, the projected merger date. a government decree allowed a longer period of time.     hughes contended it was better to formally combine the companies with the status of reed already settled. baker apparently sees no reason to speed up the sale.     carroll said baker had previously estimated 110 to 130 mln dlrs in savings if the companies were combined without selling reed. but he said baker now thinks 75 to 85 mln dlrs will be saved while hughes sees a saving of only 50 to 60 mln dlrs.     carroll also noted that since the merger accord was first signed ""the outlook for the industry has improved materially."" hughes may simply feel the pressure on the oil service industry is lifting.  reuter ;","('acq',)","('acq',)"

""security is, has been and continues to be a highly profitable and obviously well managed company,"" he said.     he added, however, first interstate, at the moment, has the advantages of having owned and managed regional banks longer and has the recognition advantage of having given its regional banks a common name.     pinola said while its coastal state banks are in good financial condition, first interstate continues to sustain serious loan losses in its rocky mountain states, where energy, real estate and agriculture dominate the economy.     asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked, he said, ""i don't think it has bottomed out, because i think most of the problems are real estate-related and the real estate problems are going to be with us for several years.""     pinola said another failing economic sector, agriculture in the midwest, has slowed expansion of first interstate's franchise operation.     first interstate has 42 franchise banks that offer first interstate financial services in ten states.     while a year ago he was considering taking his franchise operation east of the mississippi river, pinola said because most of the franchise banks are now in the west, expansion into the midwest must come first.     calling the franchise system, ""moderately profitable,"" pinola said, ""it is going to take a rejuvenation of the agriculture sector for us to commence franchising at the speed we were generating before the last year or two.""     on the banking industry in general, pinola said he thinks 1987 will be another bad year for loan losses, with only banks with minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits.  reuter ;","('acq',)","('acq',)"

2770,"economic spotlight - bolivia bolivia, once latin america's most delinquent debtor, is preparing for a second international monetary fund agreement after an economic stabilisation program has effectively slowed inflation and reduced public spending.     a fund spokesman said an imf team would visit la paz shortly to discuss terms of the new agreement.     he said the imf had disbursed 130 mln dlrs here and 20 mln dlrs are pending under the one year agreement that ends this month. the accord provided for a stand-by loan, a compensatory financing facility and a structural adjustment facility.     the spokesman said that if the agreement is renewed, bolivia can expect a further 60-mln-dlr stand-by loan over the next 12 months.     bolivia's agreement with the imf, its first since 1980, opened the door to rescheduling negotiations with the paris club and argentina and brazil, which hold 2.5 billion dlrs of bolivia's 4.0-billion-dlr foreign debt.     central bank president javier nogales told reuters the negotiations with the paris club, which have yet to be finalised, had been extremely successful.     nogales said the paris club had agreed to reschedule bolivia's debt over 10 years with five to six years grace and had waived all interest payments until the end of 1988.     bilateral discussions on interest rates continue, he said.     nogales said bolivia was expecting some 400 mln dlrs in disbursements this year from lender countries and international agencies, including the world bank and the inter-american development bank, although diplomatic and banking sources put the figure at closer to 300 mln dlrs.     nogales said bolivia's net international reserves are around 250 mln dlrs, up from one mln dlrs when president ictor paz estenssoro took office in august 1985. nogales said the capital flow on bolivia's debt servicing versus new credits had changed from a net outflow of 200 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow of 130 mln dlrs in 1986.     bolivia's return from the financial wilderness follows paz estenssoro's economic stabilisation program. he inherited inflation of 23,000 pct a year, state enterprises that were losing hundreds of mlns of dlrs and a currency that traded on the black market at up to 16 times its official rate.     paz estenssoro froze public sector wages, set a market- related rate for the peso, introduced tax reforms and laid off thousands of workers in state corporations.     inflation has been running at 10 pct a year for the past six months, according to the central bank, and the government  expects the economy to grow three pct this year after a 14 pct contraction over the last six years.     the government is also proposing a novel solution to its debt to commercial banks, some 900 mln dlrs, on which interest has not been paid since march, 1984.     nogales said that over the next few months bolivia would make a one-time offer to buy back all its commercial debt at the price it trades on the international secondary market --  10-15 cents on the dlr. he said bolivia's commercial bank steering committee agreed at a meeting in new york to consider the proposal, but it is still unclear what proportion of the country's creditor banks will take up the offer.     one foreign banker speculated that bolivia might be able to buy back up to 30 pct of its commercial debt paper under the deal, mostly from small banks who have written off their loans to the country.     but he said the larger creditors were more interested in a scheme of debt-equity swaps, similar to that which has operated in chile for the past two years.     the bolivian government has yet to draw up proposals for debt-equity swaps, but the banker said it was planning to privatise more than 100 state companies and these could serve as a basis for such a scheme.     foreign bankers said this type of proposal might prove attractive to bolivia in the long run, especially as the government realises that it will have to attract a large amount of new capital in order to grow.     planning minister gonzalo sanchez de lozada told reuters that bolivia was hoping for five to six billion dlrs in new investment over the next 10 to 12 years.     the government realises that in order to remain viable, bolivia will need to develop new exports.     the price of tin, which accounted for some 45 pct of bolivia's exports in 1984, has collapsed on the world markets, and gas, the country's major revenue earner, is in abundant supply in the region.  reuter ;","('tin',)","('tin',)"

""it would slow growth in germany and japan which would adversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it would drive interest rates up here which would throw us, if not (into) recession, into slower growth,"" he said.     asked if higher u.s. interest rates would stabilize the dollar, balladur said: ""when a currency is maintained artificially high, by artificially high interest rates, it is not healthy.""     and resorting to higher interest rates could lead to recession, he said.     acknowledging the dollar's latest slide was now a fact of life, balladur said, ""there may be adjustments of course in one or other currencies, this is not a fixed rate system.""     but federal reserve board chairman paul volcker said he might rein in credit if the dollar's slide deepens.     u.s. monetary sources also said washington wanted it understood by markets the seven's commitments were genuine.     ""the united states and the six major industrial countries are fully committed to implementing our undertakings in these agreements,"" baker told the meetings.     darman said baker had been misinterpreted by markets which wrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a further decline in the dollar. baker, darman said, was committed to stabilizing currencies at current levels.     last week's statement from the seven reaffirmed a february 22 agreement in paris in which the reagan administration agreed to reach a budget deficit compromise with congress and to fight protectionism.     west germany and japan, meanwhile, agreed to stimulate domestic demand and lead a global upturn.     ministers believed the paris pact was bolstered by japan's promise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget.     the sources said they believed baker saw it as a major action. but the seven seem to accept their commitment to stable currencies applied to today's exchange rates and not those at the time of the paris agreement, when the dollar stood higher.     the paris accord said, ""currencies (are) within ranges broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals, given the policy commitments summarized in this statement.""     now they accept the dollar's lower level, especially against the yen, as hard reality that is nonetheless consistent with the agreement. ""the ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals,"" last week's statement read.     monetary sources said policymakers understood markets were focusing on instability created by the gap between the u.s. trade deficit and the surpluses of west germany and japan rather than prospective policy changes. european monetary sources said bonn was still unconvinced that washington meant business with its commitment to cut the budget deficit.  reuter ;","('dlr',)","('money-fx',)"

2801,"herrington says he may call for oil tax benefits energy secretary john herrington said he may recommend to the white house that the domestic oil industry be given tax benefits to help it produce more oil and head off increasing u.s. dependence on foreign oil.     he said also at a news conference that he would recommend to the white house that the fill rate of the strategic petroleum reserve be increased from its planned 35,000 barrels per day.     the oil reserve fill rate capacity is 100,000 barrels a day.     herrington said he had always advocated a greater fill rate for the petroleum reserve, but the rate had been kept down because of budgetary constraints.     herrington did not disclose what tax incentives he might advocate, but u.s. officials have shown interest in tax benefits for oil and gas exploration and for research and development into new ways to extract oil which is now considered uneconomical to produce.     he made the remarks in conjunction with the release of the energy department's study on oil's impact on national security.     herrington said that before he disclosed what recommendations for tax benefits for the oil and gas industry he might make, he would raise the matter with the white house economic policy committee to see if the proposals to increase oil production made good tax policy.     he said he would like to increase u.s. production by one mln barrels a day.     the report said that by the end of the century the united states may be relying on foreign sources for 50 pct of its oil consumption, posing a serious economic and national security threat.  reuter ;","('crude',)","('crude',)"
